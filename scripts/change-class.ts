/**
 * Is a change to the product, or to the data?
 *
 * The owner's rule, 28 September 2026: "i want them to go through my approval (not the typical data cron jobs
 * that increase freshness or coverage but the changes to the site)". So a wave of fetched trials ships without
 * him; moving a block, renaming a section or changing a component waits for him.
 *
 * The line is drawn on what a change can do to a reader, not on who made it:
 *
 *   data     a record's content, a generated artefact, a fetcher's output. It changes what the page says.
 *   product  anything that decides what a page shows, in what order, or what it is called. It changes the page.
 *
 * `src/data` is data with one exception that matters: a file there can carry a label or a section title, and
 * `src/lib/i18n` is entirely labels, so it is product. Tests and documents are neither and never gate a deploy.
 *
 *   npx tsx scripts/change-class.ts <ref>..<ref>     classify a range (defaults to origin/main..HEAD)
