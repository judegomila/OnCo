/**
 * What a reader actually downloads, measured against the live site.
 *
 * Every page budget in the repo is on the static markup, because that is what react-dom/server can produce inside
 * vitest. `src/app/chrome-size.test.ts` says the assumption out loud: "the RSC payload cannot be rendered in
 * vitest, but the same trees drive both". On 25 September 2026 that assumption broke. `/timeline/` renders 528 KB
 * of markup, inside its 640 KB budget, and ships 2,138 KB, because the hydration payload is 1,610 KB on top. The
 * budget was guarding a quarter of the page.
 *
 * So this measures the exported page: total bytes, the markup, and the payload inlined for hydration. It is not a
 * test, because it needs the built site; run it against production or a local export and record the numbers.
