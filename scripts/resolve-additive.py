"""Resolve conflicts where both sides only add lines: nav entries, i18n entries, registrations.

Every country page appends one line to the same place in src/lib/country-pages.ts and the data index (it used to be
nav.ts, eight i18n files and RouteIcon.tsx too), so two country branches always conflict there and both sides are
always right. This keeps both, HEAD
first, and refuses any hunk where a side deleted or changed a line rather than adding one.
