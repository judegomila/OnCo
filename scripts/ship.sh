# A check page is a path, or `id:<entity-id>` to have the record's real route resolved from the built API. It ran
# nineteen times on 25 September 2026 and lived in /tmp until then, which is why it is here now.
# The local `next build` was dropped: Vercel builds from source on deploy, a failed remote build never aliases, and the
# local build cost 25 minutes and 9 GB of disk per chain (it also triggered the 21 Sept memory crash). We verify after.

# The owner's rule, 28 September 2026: data ships, product waits for him. A wave of fetched trials is freshness
# and goes live; moving a block, renaming a section or editing a component changes the product he is responsible
# for, and he has not seen it. scripts/change-class.ts draws the line and scripts/change-class.test.ts holds it.
#
# This refuses rather than silently doing something else, because a chain that quietly changes what it does is
# worse than one that stops. To send a product change for review instead: scripts/propose-product-change.sh.
# Nothing here can bind an agent holding the owner's credentials; what it does is make the safe path the default,
# make every product change visible before it ships, and leave a trail. Real enforcement is the Vercel setting
# that restricts production to a branch only he merges, which is his to turn on.
