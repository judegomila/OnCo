            <p>The same matcher as the <Link href="/tumor-board/" className="underline">tumour board</Link> scores every product, technology and trial against one biomarker (target match 3, glossary-term match 2, technology match 2, tag match 1). Each hit is then placed in every cancer column the graph links it to, directly or through its products. A product is &ldquo;approved&rdquo; in a cell when the <Link href="/regulatory/regions/" className="underline">regional approvals table</Link> records approval or conditional approval for your region; where we hold no regional record, the corpus status (usually the FDA) is used and the tooltip says so.</p>

            <p>Approval in a cell means the product is approved somewhere in that cancer, not necessarily for that biomarker-defined subgroup; a PD-1 antibody approved for lung cancer will appear in the PD-L1 row for every cancer it is approved in. Withdrawn, negative and historic records are excluded. Counts are a map of what the corpus documents, not a treatment recommendation. Click through to the tumour board to see the products, cautions and trials behind a cell.</p>
