            <p>Confirmed events carry a source that states the date: a PDUFA goal date in a sponsor release, an advisory committee notice, a congress programme. Expected events are our estimate from the registry primary completion date and sponsor statements; treat them as a quarter, not a day.</p>
            <p>Companies are attached directly for catalysts and derived for readout-calendar rows from the products named (each product&rsquo;s companies in the corpus). Past events stay in the data and can be shown with the checkbox.</p>

            <p>Subscribe to <code className="text-xs">{FEED_PATH}</code> in Google Calendar, Outlook or Apple Calendar to get every event, including expected ones placed on the first day of their period. The download button exports only the rows you have filtered to.</p>
