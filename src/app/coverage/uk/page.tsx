            <p>This page is a map, not a decision. NICE publishes new and updated technology appraisals every week, Cancer Drugs Fund entries move to routine commissioning or are withdrawn, and whether a drug is available to <em>you</em> depends on the exact indication, line of treatment, biomarker and, sometimes, the hospital. TA numbers here were recorded from memory of the guidance and checked against the linked page where possible; where a number was not verified the row says so and links to a NICE search.</p>
            <p>Before acting on any row: open the linked NICE page and read the recommendation section; check the <a href={CDF_LIST_URL} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="underline">current CDF list</a>; and ask your oncologist or clinical nurse specialist whether the appraised indication matches your situation and whether an individual funding request, a trial or an early access scheme applies. In Scotland check the <a href="https://scottishmedicines.org.uk/medicines-advice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="underline">SMC</a>; in Wales the <a href="https://awttc.nhs.wales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="underline">AWTTC</a>.</p>
