            <p>A row&apos;s value is a count of linked records, a ratio of two such counts, or the difference between two years on the record. The registry lives in <code>src/lib/rankings.ts</code>; a table is only registered when the field it counts is filled on at least 60 percent of the records it draws from, and that share is printed under every table.</p>
            <p>Tables considered and not built, because the corpus does not yet carry the field widely enough: institutions by trials (4 percent of trials name an institution), cancers by ideas (38 percent of ideas name a cancer), time from first trial to first approval (trials carry a readout year, not a start date, on 18 percent of records), and countries by approvals or trial sites (approvals carry a regulator, not a country, and trials carry no site list).
