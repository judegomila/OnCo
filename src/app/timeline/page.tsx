/**
 * One timeline over every year in oncology, at two scales.
 *
 * The whole field at a glance is the chart: one column a year, from the first year the corpus dates anything to,
 * stacked by what kind of thing the entries were. One year in detail is its own record at /years/<year>/, and the
 * scrubber below reads the same dated fields year by year.
 *
 * The findings under it are the point of gathering the dates in one place. Each carries the denominator it was
 * computed over and a caveat naming what it measures about the corpus rather than about oncology; a finding with
 * fewer than MIN_N cases says plainly that the corpus cannot support it (src/lib/timeline.ts).
