    "summary": "Four routes to candidate binders are described in primary experiments. In 1976 Köhler and Milstein fused spleen cells from immunised mice with myeloma cells; the hybrid lines grew in culture and about 10 per cent of them showed activity against the sheep red cells used to immunise, so each line had to be tested for what it made. In 1990 McCafferty and colleagues displayed complete antibody variable domains on filamentous phage, showed that the phage bound antigen specifically, and isolated rare phage (one in a million) by affinity chromatography. In 1997 Boder and Wittrup displayed single-chain antibody fragments on yeast and used flow cytometry to compare binding kinetics, selecting a variant with a threefold lower dissociation rate. In 2023 Watson and colleagues designed binders to five targets with the RFdiffusion network, took 95 designs per target, expressed and purified them from E. coli and screened them by single-point biolayer interferometry at 10 micromolar; binding at or above half the maximal response of a positive control counted as success, the overall rate was 19 per cent, and full titrations on a subset of designs showed nanomolar affinities. Each result is a measured interaction under stated laboratory conditions. A selected, enriched or designed sequence is a candidate; the studies do not test activity in cells in a patient, absence of binding to healthy tissue, or clinical benefit.",

      "Sources and depth. The three older papers were read at abstract level only; Watson et al. (2023) was read in open-access full text for the screening method, the 19 per cent success definition and the subset titrations. A computational design counts as a binder only after it is made and measured: in Watson et al. 95 designs per target were screened at 10 micromolar and only designs at or above half the control's maximal response counted, so most tested designs did not meet that criterion, and ranking scores are predictions.",
      "Enriched is not fully specific. Phage selection recovers rare phage (one in a million in McCafferty et al., 1990) under the conditions used, which favours binding under those conditions and not specificity across all targets. Boder and Wittrup (1997) used quantitative flow cytometry to compare kinetics on yeast; display level and binding strength are separate quantities, and a brighter cell is not automatically a better isolated binder. The display-level point is a general reading rule; the abstract does not describe a separate display measurement.",
      "Selection against a purified or tagged target can miss the native epitope on cells or select a binder to the tag or an altered preparation, so a hit is retested outside its selection system with target-negative, unrelated-protein and tag controls. This is general experimental practice stated in the source lesson; none of the four primary papers here tests it, and binding to a cancer-associated protein does not show absence of binding to healthy tissue.",
      "Assay card for a discovery hit. Input and consumption: clones or expressed proteins, defined target preparations and cell controls, with finite aliquots. Output and units: selected sequences, binding curves and assay-specific fluorescence, with a computational rank a different output. Threshold: define a hit relative to assay controls, with no universal therapeutic-binder threshold. Failure modes: display level, enrichment bias, tag binding, aggregation and target preparation. Validation tier: discovery and preclinical interaction evidence, not a clinical prediction."

Sequence changes how hard this is: peptides rich in aggregation-prone sequences are difficult, and a 2014 report described automated backbone protection that improved handling, quality and yield of several challenging sequences. For personalised cancer vaccines, an automated flow synthesiser made 30-mer peptides in under 35 minutes and 15 to 16-mers in under 20 minutes, with purity comparable to or higher than other methods (Truex et al., 2020). The same paper reports what the earlier route cost: of 598 immunising peptides designed and ordered in earlier studies, 400 (67 per cent) could be synthesised and purified to at least 95 per cent purity, with an average lead time of 18 to 20 weeks for 20 peptides, and a commercial vendor returned 10 of 29 test peptides at more than 95 per cent HPLC purity; these 29 peptides had been deliberately selected because they were particularly difficult and time-consuming to make, rather than as a typical vendor workload. In that paper mass spectrometry of the unpurified peptides showed the desired mass as the main product for all 29, and purity was measured separately by analytical reverse-phase HPLC. Synthesis, purification, identity testing and lot release are separate steps, and a peptide that is made and pure has not been shown to prime T cells or to benefit a patient.",

      "The cycle, as run in the neoantigen paper. Truex et al. (2020) used Fmoc-based solid-phase synthesis: the C-terminal amino acid was loaded onto a resin, the terminal protecting group was removed (Fmoc removal was followed by UV detection), the next activated protected amino acid was coupled in excess and soluble reagents were washed away, and the cycle repeated. Flow conditions achieved amide-bond coupling in seconds where standard batch methods need minutes to hours. The finished chain was cleaved and lyophilised as a trifluoroacetic acid salt.",
      "Sequence difficulty. Chain association (aggregation) of growing peptides blocks coupling, and double coupling does not help because the cause is intermolecular association; introducing removable backbone protection improved handling, quality and yield of several challenging sequences (Abdel-Aal et al., 2014). Washing removes soluble material but does not repair a faulty chain. This study did not make every peptide equally easy.",
      "After cleavage the crude peptide is a mixture needing purification and characterisation, and the synthesiser's last step is not a release decision. In Truex et al. electrospray mass spectrometry of the unpurified products showed the desired mass as the main product for all 29 test peptides, while purity was measured separately by analytical reverse-phase HPLC at 214 nm, with greater than 95 per cent HPLC purity used as the purity criterion. In that deliberately difficult 29-peptide commercial-vendor comparison, 17 peptides were synthesised, 10 passed after purification, and 7 stayed at 89 to 94 per cent even after two or three rounds. The 95 per cent figure is that paper's criterion, not a clinical-release threshold.",
      "Assay peptides versus the clinical product. The same paper made 15 to 16-mer peptides for immune-assessment assays and longer immunising peptides of up to 30 residues for vaccination, and its authors describe clinical-grade manufacture as something they envision. Making an assay peptide does not show manufacture of a formulated, released vaccine product, and chemical assembly does not select a useful cancer antigen or show benefit. A shorter instrument run does not establish the turnaround of the whole program."

Release concerns that lot, not the general reputation of its manufacturer.",
      "What a release review brings together: test results with their methods and criteria, manufacturing and deviation records, lot and version identity, and stability and handling information. In US finished-drug rules the quality control unit reviews and approves production and control records before a batch is released or distributed (21 CFR 211.192). A certificate of analysis may summarise results but does not replace that review.",
      "Dispositions. FDA's quality-systems guidance describes the quality unit approving or rejecting materials and drug products; US regulations give the quality unit authority to approve or reject materials and drug products (21 CFR 211.22(a)); other provisions describe quarantine or withholding from use while materials or products await release (211.80(d), 211.84(a), 211.142(a)). Hold pending review is a plain-language description of that unresolved disposition. A result that has not arrived is neither a pass nor a failure. Inference lesson: a spreadsheet that reports all tests passed because it lists only completed tests has lost the missingness information; with a required activity result pending, completed release is not established.",
      "Out-of-specification handling. FDA's May 2022 guidance calls repeated testing until a pass followed by disregarding the failures without scientific justification testing into compliance, which it describes as unscientific and objectionable under CGMP. It asks that the number of retests be set in advance in a procedure and not adjusted according to results, and it contrasts averages: initial 89 then 90 and 91 per cent averages 90 and tends to confirm the failure, while 80 then 85 and 105 also averages 90 but presents a very different picture. Releasing despite an initial failure that has not been invalidated should follow a full investigation. The guidance applies to chemistry-based laboratory testing of drugs regulated by CDER and says it is not intended to address biological assays, so it cannot simply be copied for a cell or potency assay.",
      "Release is a quality decision. It is separate from regulatory authorisation of the product, a patient's eligibility and evidence of benefit, and a released stamp on a report does not answer those. For US licensed biological products, manufacturer release follows completion of applicable tests under 21 CFR 610.1. Separately, under 610.2 FDA may require samples and protocols and, on notification, bar distribution until the relevant CBER or CDER Director releases the lot. These are distinct manufacturer and official-release steps; this example does not establish other jurisdictions' rules."

In mice, a peptide-TLR-7/8a conjugate platform was built to self-assemble into nanoparticles of uniform size (about 20 nm) whatever the peptide, to address the physicochemical variability of neoantigens (Lynn et al., 2020). For autologous CAR T cells, FDA's 2024 guidance notes variability in the starting cells and recommends maintaining chain of identity from collection to administration, with at least two unique identifiers on labels of autologous products.

Most phase 1 investigational drugs are exempt from 21 CFR part 211 under 21 CFR 210.2(c), and FDA's 2008 guidance applies CGMP under section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to them, so investigational does not mean quality controls are optional. GMP supports reliable clinical investigation; it does not show efficacy."
