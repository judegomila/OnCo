    burden: "About three quarters of new bladder cancers; rarely fatal at this stage but it recurs in half of patients and progresses to muscle invasion in a fifth of the high-risk group, so years of cystoscopic surveillance make it one of the most expensive cancers to manage.",
    tldr: "Most bladder cancers are found while still confined to the lining. They are scraped out through the urethra and, when higher risk, treated with BCG instilled into the bladder; the challenge is the frequent recurrences and the patients whose tumours stop responding to BCG.",
    summary: "Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer includes papillary tumours confined to the mucosa (Ta) or lamina propria (T1) and flat carcinoma in situ. It is diagnosed by cystoscopy and removed by transurethral resection, with a single immediate dose of intravesical chemotherapy for low-risk tumours. Intermediate- and high-risk disease receives induction and maintenance intravesical BCG, the oldest cancer immunotherapy in use, which halves recurrence and reduces progression. Tumours that recur despite adequate BCG are called BCG-unresponsive; radical cystectomy is the standard, and bladder-sparing alternatives have arrived: pembrolizumab (KEYNOTE-057), nadofaragene firadenovec, nogapendekin alfa inbakicept with BCG, the gemcitabine-releasing device TAR-200 and the oncolytic virus cretostimogene. Worldwide BCG shortages have pushed dose-reduction and chemotherapy substitutes into practice. Blue-light cystoscopy improves detection of flat lesions.",

    tldr: "Once bladder cancer has grown into the muscle it needs more than scraping out: chemotherapy then removal of the bladder, or chemoradiation to keep it. For cancer that has spread, the antibody-drug conjugate enfortumab vedotin with pembrolizumab has replaced platinum chemotherapy as the first treatment.",
    summary: "Muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma is treated with cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical cystectomy and urinary diversion, or by trimodality bladder preservation (maximal resection plus chemoradiation) in suitable patients. Perioperative immunotherapy has entered practice: adjuvant nivolumab after cystectomy (CheckMate 274) and durvalumab with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and after surgery (NIAGARA), which improved overall survival. For metastatic disease, enfortumab vedotin with pembrolizumab nearly doubled survival compared with platinum chemotherapy (EV-302) and became the standard first-line treatment in 2023; erdafitinib is used for FGFR3-altered tumours, and platinum chemotherapy followed by avelumab maintenance remains an option.
