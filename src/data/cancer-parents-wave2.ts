    // The burden is written with its cohorts and sources by the September 2026 family round
    // (src/data/spikes/breast-core.ts). The pair that stood here, "about 2.3 million new cases and 670,000 deaths"
    // and "in high-income countries about nine in ten women diagnosed are alive five years later", carried no source,
    // contradicted the sourced GLOBOCAN 2024 figures already in src/data/spikes/tnbc-core.ts, and was not true of the
    // UK on this corpus's own survival figures. The tldr below is corrected in place, because the schema requires it
    // on every cancer record: its 70 / 15 / 15 split presented three overlapping categories as a partition, and
    // hormone receptor-positive HER2-positive disease belongs to two of them at once.
    tldr: "Breast cancer is not one disease, and the result that decides which page you need is the receptor result: whether the cancer carries oestrogen and progesterone receptors, and whether it carries too much HER2. Those two answers give four boxes, not three, with a page for each. Grade and stage do not change which page you read; they change what happens on it.",
    summary: "Breast cancer arises from the milk ducts or lobules and is classified by the receptors on its cells: oestrogen and progesterone receptors, and HER2. Hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative disease is treated with endocrine therapy and CDK4/6 inhibitors; HER2-positive disease with HER2 antibodies and antibody-drug conjugates; triple-negative disease with chemotherapy, immunotherapy and, for BRCA carriers, PARP inhibitors. Ductal carcinoma in situ is a precursor confined to the duct, and about one percent of cases occur in men. Screening mammography from around age 50, breast-conserving surgery with radiotherapy, sentinel node biopsy and genomic tests that spare chemotherapy are common to all types. Most patients present early and are cured; metastatic disease is treatable for years but rarely curable.",

    // their shares and their axis by src/data/spikes/breast-core.ts, which groups the 37 children by what a report
