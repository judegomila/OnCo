    summary: "Breast cancer arises from the milk ducts or lobules and is classified by the receptors on its cells: oestrogen and progesterone receptors, and HER2. Hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative disease is treated with endocrine therapy and CDK4/6 inhibitors; HER2-positive disease with HER2 antibodies and antibody-drug conjugates; triple-negative disease with chemotherapy, immunotherapy and, for BRCA carriers, PARP inhibitors. Ductal carcinoma in situ is a precursor confined to the duct, and about one percent of cases occur in men. Screening mammography from around age 50, breast-conserving surgery with radiotherapy, sentinel node biopsy and genomic tests that spare chemotherapy are common to all types. Most patients present early and are cured; metastatic disease is treatable for years but rarely curable.",
