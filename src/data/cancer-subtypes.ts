    aka: ["Malignant pleural mesothelioma", "MPM"],
    burden: "About four in five mesotheliomas arise in the pleura; roughly 2,500 cases a year in the UK and 3,000 in the US, almost all decades after asbestos exposure, with incidence still rising in countries that banned asbestos late.",
    tldr: "Pleural mesothelioma grows in the lining of the lung after asbestos exposure and causes breathlessness and chest pain from fluid and thickening. It is rarely curable; the first-line choice is nivolumab with ipilimumab or pembrolizumab with chemotherapy, and surgery to remove the lining is no longer recommended outside trials.",
    summary: "Pleural mesothelioma is the commonest form of mesothelioma. It presents with pleural effusion, breathlessness and chest wall pain 20 to 50 years after asbestos exposure, and is diagnosed by thoracoscopic biopsy with immunohistochemistry (calretinin, WT1, D2-40) and loss of BAP1 or MTAP. Epithelioid histology, about two thirds of cases, carries a better outlook than biphasic or sarcomatoid disease. CheckMate 743 made nivolumab plus ipilimumab the first new first-line treatment in 16 years, and KEYNOTE-483 added pembrolizumab with platinum-pemetrexed; both are now standard, with histology guiding the choice. MARS 2 showed that extended pleurectomy and decortication harms rather than helps, so surgery is confined to diagnosis, pleurodesis and trials. Hemithoracic radiotherapy, tumour treating fields and mesothelin-directed therapies are the main lines of research.",

    burden: "About one in ten mesotheliomas; a few hundred cases a year in the US. The asbestos link is weaker than in the pleura, it affects more women and younger people, and selected patients live many years after surgery.",
    tldr: "Peritoneal mesothelioma grows in the lining of the abdomen, causing swelling, pain and fluid. Unlike its pleural cousin it is often treated with major surgery to strip the lining followed by heated chemotherapy washed through the abdomen, which can give long survival in fit patients with epithelioid disease.",
    summary: "Peritoneal mesothelioma presents with abdominal distension from ascites, pain, weight loss or a mass found at surgery, and is diagnosed by laparoscopic biopsy with the same immunohistochemistry as pleural disease. Asbestos exposure is found in only a minority; BAP1 germline mutations account for some cases, and the disease is commoner in women than pleural mesothelioma. For fit patients with epithelioid histology and disease that can be removed, cytoreductive surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) is the standard in specialist centres and gives median survival of five years or more in series, though no randomised trial exists. Patients who are not candidates receive platinum-pemetrexed chemotherapy, with immunotherapy increasingly used on the basis of small trials and the pleural data. Well-differentiated papillary and multicystic forms behave almost benignly and are managed separately.",
