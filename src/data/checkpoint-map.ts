/**
 * Checkpoint families: one typed taxonomy for the two unrelated biologies the word "checkpoint" covers.
 *
 *  - Immune checkpoints: receptors and ligands on immune cells, tumour cells and antigen-presenting cells that hold
 *    T cells, NK cells and macrophages back, plus the co-stimulatory receptors agonist drugs press and the metabolic
 *    and soluble brakes of the tumour microenvironment.
 *  - Cell-intrinsic checkpoints: the gates every dividing cell passes (G1/S, G2/M, the DNA-damage response and the
 *    spindle assembly checkpoint), which tumours disable and then depend on.
 *
 * Every member is a target record in the corpus (`id` is the target id; new records are in `checkpointTargets` below,
 * built from the HGNC and UniProt REST APIs). Where a protein is expressed comes from the UniProt tissue-specificity
 * or function comment for the accession named, or from a cited review; drug statuses come from the drug records the
 * member links to (their approvals carry regions and indications) and, for agents that have no record here, from a
 * named ClinicalTrials.gov study. Discontinuations quote the registry's "why stopped" field. Nothing is stated without
 * a source; where none was found the member says so.
 *
 * Rendered at /checkpoints/, /checkpoints/immune/ and /checkpoints/cell-cycle/ (src/lib/checkpoints.ts derives the
 * rows from the graph); the taxonomy is checked by src/data/checkpoint-map.test.ts.

    tldr: "In cancer the word checkpoint means two unrelated things: a brake on immune cells that tumours press and checkpoint inhibitor drugs release, or a gate inside every dividing cell that stops it copying or splitting damaged DNA.",
    summary: "Immune checkpoints are receptor-ligand pairs such as PD-1 with PD-L1, CTLA-4 with CD80 and CD86, LAG-3, TIM-3 and TIGIT that hold T cells and NK cells back; the drugs are antibodies that block them (or, for co-stimulatory receptors, agonists that press them). Cell-cycle checkpoints are the G1/S, G2/M and spindle assembly gates governed by cyclin D-CDK4/6 and RB, ATR-CHK1-WEE1, and MPS1, BUB1 and Aurora B, with the DNA-damage response behind them; the drugs are small molecules such as palbociclib, olaparib and azenosertib. The two families share a word and nothing else; OnCo keeps a hub for each, with every member, its partner, where it is expressed and the drugs against it.",
