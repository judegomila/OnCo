The rate of dying from cancer has fallen for more than thirty years, and five-year survival has passed 70 per cent for the first time. Lung cancer still kills more Americans than colorectal and pancreatic cancer combined.",
    detail: "Cancer Statistics, 2026 projects 2,114,850 new cases and 626,140 deaths, using incidence from central cancer registries through 2022 and mortality from the National Center for Health Statistics through 2023. The mortality rate has declined continuously since 1991, averting 4.8 million deaths, which the authors attribute to falling smoking, earlier detection and better treatment. Five-year relative survival reached 70 per cent for diagnoses in 2015 to 2021, against 63 per cent in the mid-1990s: 69 per cent for regional-stage and 35 per cent for distant-stage disease, up from 54 and 17 per cent. The largest gains were in the most fatal cancers, including myeloma (32 to 62 per cent), liver (7 to 22), metastatic melanoma (16 to 35) and metastatic lung cancer (2 to 10). GLOBOCAN 2022 puts the American age-standardised incidence at 366.95 per 100,000 and mortality at 82.33, the fourth highest incidence of 186 countries (behind Australia, New Zealand and Denmark) on 2.38 million cases, and a mortality-to-incidence ratio of 0.22, the second lowest of the 33 countries with more than 100,000 cases. A high incidence with a low ratio is what heavy screening and effective treatment look like together; it is also what over-diagnosis looks like, and the two cannot be separated from these figures alone.",

The variables it routinely collects are demographics, primary site, morphology, stage at diagnosis, first course of treatment and follow-up for vital status. Anything after the first course, and any recurrence short of death, is outside the file, which is why treatment-sequence questions in the United States are answered from claims (SEER-Medicare), hospital registries (the National Cancer Database) or electronic-record cohorts instead.

Rectal cancer incidence overall rose 1 per cent a year from 2018 to 2022 after decades of decline and now accounts for 32 per cent of colorectal cancer, up from 27 per cent in the mid-2000s. The rise in the 50 to 64 group was confined to regional and distant stage, and mortality in that group has risen about 1 per cent a year since 2019, steepest (2.3 per cent a year) in White individuals. Mortality in adults under 50 has risen about 1 per cent a year since 2004.

American adult smoking is now about 9 per cent and falling; adult obesity is about 40 per cent. That pair of numbers explains much of where the cancer profile is heading.",
    detail: "Islami and colleagues estimated that in 2019, 40.0 per cent of incident cancers in adults aged 30 and over (713,340 of 1,781,649, excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) and 44.0 per cent of cancer deaths (262,120 of 595,737) were attributable to the exposures they could quantify: cigarette smoking 19.3 per cent of cases and 28.5 per cent of deaths, excess body weight 7.6 and 7.3 per cent, alcohol 5.4 and 4.1 per cent, with the rest from second-hand smoke, diet, inactivity, ultraviolet radiation and seven carcinogenic infections. Lung cancer carried the most attributable cases (201,660) and deaths (122,740). Their earlier estimate, for 2014, was 42.0 and 45.1 per cent; the small fall is mostly smoking. The CDC's early release from the 2025 National Health Interview Survey puts current cigarette smoking among adults at 9.1 per cent, and NHANES for August 2021 to August 2023 puts adult obesity at 40.3 per cent.

Those are paid under Part B, where the patient owes 20 per cent of the cost with no annual maximum. The same cancer can therefore cost very different amounts depending on how the medicine is given.",
    detail: "Medicare.gov states that in 2026 a Part D plan may set a deductible of at most 615 dollars, that the enrollee pays 25 per cent coinsurance until out-of-pocket spending on covered Part D drugs reaches 2,100 dollars, and that catastrophic coverage then costs nothing for the rest of the year; the cap rises to 2,400 dollars in 2027. There was no cap at all before the Inflation Reduction Act redesigned the benefit for 2025. The Medicare Prescription Payment Plan, which every Part D plan must offer, spreads that liability across the calendar year but does not reduce it. Part B is a different benefit: the 2026 standard premium is 202.90 dollars a month, the annual deductible 283 dollars, and the beneficiary generally owes 20 per cent of the Medicare-approved amount for each covered service and clinician-administered drug, with no annual out-of-pocket maximum in Original Medicare. Put the two side by side with prices OnCo already holds. Ibrutinib, a capsule, listed at 14,934 dollars for a 30-day supply in 2023 and has a negotiated Medicare price of 9,319 dollars from 2026: it is a Part D drug, so a Medicare patient taking it all year pays at most 2,100 dollars. Pembrolizumab, an infusion, listed at 11,115.20 dollars for a 200 mg dose every three weeks in 2024: it is a Part B drug, so the same patient owes 20 per cent of the Medicare-approved amount (average sales price plus 6 per cent, which is below list) on every dose, seventeen times a year, with no ceiling. The usual remedies are a Medigap policy, a Medicare Advantage plan with its own out-of-pocket maximum, or Medicaid. Negotiated Medicare prices took effect on 1 January 2026 for the first ten selected drugs (including Imbruvica for blood cancers); the second set of fifteen, effective in 2027, includes Xtandi for prostate cancer, Pomalyst for myeloma and Kaposi sarcoma, Ibrance for breast cancer and Calquence for CLL and mantle cell lymphoma.",

In a propensity-matched follow-up of 3,841 pairs from the same cohort, filing for bankruptcy after diagnosis carried an adjusted hazard ratio for death of 1.79 (95 per cent CI 1.64 to 1.96).

    detail: "Wagner and colleagues took the 47 drugs the FDA first approved for adult haematological or solid cancers between 2011 and 2015 and compared their labels with the NCCN guidelines. The 47 drugs carried 69 FDA-approved indications but 113 NCCN recommendations: 69 (62 per cent) overlapped with the label and 44 (39 per cent) went beyond it, an average of 0.92 extra recommendations per drug. Of those 44, 10 (23 per cent) rested on evidence from randomised controlled trials and 7 (16 per cent) on phase 3 studies. Over 21 months of follow-up the FDA went on to approve 6 of the 44 (14 per cent). The authors concluded that NCCN was justifying coverage of costly and toxic drugs on weak evidence. NCCN's leadership replied in Annals of Oncology, setting out the panel process, the rule disqualifying panel members who receive 20,000 dollars or more in non-research support from a single company or 50,000 dollars in aggregate in a year, and the fact that guideline development is funded exclusively by member institutions' dues.",

Generics are the exception: they are cheaper in the United States than almost anywhere.",

Median monthly treatment cost at launch in 2018 to 2019 was 14,580 dollars in the United States against 5,888 in Germany, 6,593 in Switzerland and 6,867 in England; the American figure in 2009 to 2010 had been 5,790 dollars. After launch, 48 of 65 (74 per cent) American cancer drugs had price increases greater than inflation, against 1 of 62 in England, 0 of 60 in Germany and 7 of 56 in Switzerland, and price changes were not associated with clinical benefit in any country. RAND's whole-market comparison for 2022 found United States manufacturer gross prices at 278 per cent of prices in 33 OECD comparison countries combined and 422 per cent for brand-name originators, before American rebates and discounts, which RAND notes are substantial and undisclosed; but unbranded generics, 90 per cent of American prescription volume, cost 67 per cent of comparison-country prices. Payment reform has not moved the total: the Oncology Care Model, which covered one in four Medicare fee-for-service patients in cancer treatment from 2016 to 2022, reduced total episode payments by about 2.1 per cent but, after the monthly care-management payments and performance bonuses paid to practices, produced cumulative net losses to Medicare of 639 million dollars.

Taken together these are why a new cancer medicine is usually approved in the United States before anywhere else.",
    detail: "The FDA's own description of priority review is a six-month goal against ten months for standard review, with designation notified within 60 days of receipt; breakthrough therapy designation requires preliminary clinical evidence of substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint and also carries a 60-day response window; real-time oncology review, given final guidance in November 2023, allows topline efficacy and safety data to be submitted before the full application without changing the statutory clock. The consequence is measurable. Kim and colleagues took all 36 oncology drugs that received their first expedited approval from the FDA between 2019 and 2023 and followed the subsequent decisions of the EMA (28), TGA (18) and PMDA (15): every one of those agencies had a longer review duration than the FDA, the EMA's median submission lag was 27 days and the TGA's exceeded 600.

Some are broken and the indication is withdrawn. And a long tail sits unresolved for years: one indication has been on an accelerated approval since 2009 and is still not settled.",

Read on 25 September 2026 they held 127 indications whose clinical benefit has been verified and converted to traditional approval, 35 withdrawn, 57 still ongoing, and 20 in an other category covering supportive-care and dosing changes: 239 indications in all since the pathway opened in 1992. Gyawali and colleagues examined the FDA's own review of the first 93 oncology accelerated approvals (December 1992 to May 2017) and found that confirmatory trials demonstrated an improvement in overall survival for 19 of them, one fifth; another fifth reported an improvement in the same surrogate used before approval. Their later analysis of 18 indications whose post-approval trials missed their primary endpoint found 11 voluntarily withdrawn, one revoked by the FDA (bevacizumab with paclitaxel for HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer, accelerated approval 22 February 2008, withdrawal 18 November 2011) and six left on the label. The same paper found the NCCN guidelines still carrying a category 1 endorsement for one of those failed indications and category 2A for seven, in some cases after the approval had been withdrawn or revoked, which under the compendia rule keeps them payable. The Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022 responded on the regulatory side: its section 3210 created an Accelerated Approval Coordinating Council, which now reports annually, alongside new withdrawal procedures.",

    plain: "American Indian and Alaska Native people have cancer incidence close to White Americans but die of cancer 18 per cent more often. Alaska Native people have the highest recorded rate of colorectal cancer of any population in the world, and it is rising fastest in the young.",
    detail: "Kratzer and colleagues compared non-Hispanic American Indian and Alaska Native people with non-Hispanic White people, restricting incidence to Purchased and Referred Care Delivery Area counties to reduce racial misclassification. Incidence was 2 per cent higher (2014 to 2018) and mortality 18 per cent higher (2015 to 2019). Breast and prostate cancer mortality were 8 and 31 per cent higher despite lower incidence and the availability of early-detection tests. Colorectal cancer incidence among indigenous Alaskans was 91.3 per 100,000 against 35.5 for White Alaskans, the highest rate in the world, and among Alaska Native people aged 20 to 49 it rose from 18.8 per 100,000 in 1998 to 2002 to 34.8 in 2014 to 2018. Death rates for liver, stomach and cervical cancer, all infection-related, and for kidney cancer were about twice those of White individuals.",

    title: "Asian American and Pacific Islander is not one population, and the aggregate hides a twofold range",
    plain: "American statistics usually report Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders as a single group with low cancer rates. Broken apart, the rate runs from 218 per 100,000 in Cambodian Americans to 475 in Native Hawaiians, and five-year survival from 42 per cent in Laotians to 74 per cent in Asian Indians and Pakistanis. The aggregate describes nobody.",
    detail: "The American Cancer Society reported SEER data for 2000 to 2022 broken into eight Asian American and three Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander ethnic groups. For 2018 to 2022, overall cancer incidence ranged from 218.3 per 100,000 in Kampuchean (Cambodian) people to 474.5 in Native Hawaiian people, the latter 1.5 times the rate for the aggregated population (307.3). The pattern differs by cause: Native Hawaiian rates are driven by breast, colorectal and prostate cancer, while infection-related cancers are highest in Asian American groups, with liver cancer highest among Vietnamese people (22.2 per 100,000) and stomach cancer highest among Korean people (17.8), each nearly double the Native Hawaiian rate. Native Hawaiian and Samoan women are twice and three times as likely to be diagnosed with uterine corpus cancer as aggregated Asian American and Pacific Islander women or White women. Five-year relative survival ranged from 42 per cent in Laotian people to 74 per cent in Asian Indian and Pakistani people, with the widest spreads in colorectal (43 to 72 per cent) and prostate cancer (63 to 97 per cent).",

    title: "Run the same cancer through an equal-access system and the gap disappears",
    plain: "The clearest experiment the United States has run on its own disparities is the Veterans Health Administration, which the study that used it calls an equal-access system. In the national registry, Black men with prostate cancer die of it about a third more often than White men. Inside the VA, that difference is zero.",
    detail: "Klebaner and colleagues identified African American and White men diagnosed with prostate cancer from 2004 to 2015 in SEER (311,691 men) and in the Veterans Health Administration (90,749 men). In SEER, African American men were more likely to present with metastatic disease (adjusted odds ratio 1.23, 95 per cent CI 1.17 to 1.30) and had a higher risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality (subdistribution hazard ratio 1.32, 95 per cent CI 1.10 to 1.60). In the VHA neither held: adjusted odds ratio 1.07 (0.98 to 1.17) for metastatic presentation, subdistribution hazard ratio 1.00 (0.93 to 1.08) for mortality. Adjusting the SEER model for disease extent, PSA and Gleason score eliminated the mortality difference there too (1.04, 0.93 to 1.16), which locates the cause in what stage the man arrives at, not in the tumour. The Medicaid expansion literature says the same thing prospectively. Lam and colleagues followed 523,802 people with breast, lung or colorectal cancer diagnosed from 2012 to 2015 and found a mortality benefit in expansion states that vanished after adjusting for stage at diagnosis, meaning the gain was earlier diagnosis rather than better treatment. Han and colleagues, across 2,555,302 newly diagnosed patients aged 18 to 62 in 42 states' registries, found two-year overall survival rising 0.44 percentage points more in expansion than non-expansion states, 0.72 points among non-Hispanic Black patients, and most in liver (2.57), pancreatic (1.80) and lung cancer (1.29), where weeks matter. None of this says biology is irrelevant; it says the part of the gap policy can move is large, and has been moved.",
