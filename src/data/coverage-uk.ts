/**
 * What the NHS offers for cancer: NICE technology appraisal (TA) outcomes, Cancer Drugs Fund (CDF) managed
 * access, and Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) advice for approved oncology products, plus a plain-English
 * explainer of how NHS cancer care and drug funding are organised.
 *
 * Rules: a TA number and year are recorded only where the appraisal is well known and the number could be
 * stated with confidence; the row links to the guidance page so it can be checked in one click. Where the
 * outcome is known but the TA number was not verified, no number is recorded and the row links to a NICE
 * search. Where nothing could be stated confidently the status is "unknown" with a NICE search link, which
 * means "not yet researched", not "not funded". Many products have several TAs (one per indication); the row
 * records one flagship appraisal and names others in the note. SMC status is "accepted" if SMC has accepted
 * the medicine for at least one cancer indication (often restricted); it is omitted where not checked.
 * Long-established generics (platinums, taxanes, anthracyclines, hormones) were never appraised as TAs and
 * are funded routinely through local formularies and NHS England chemotherapy protocols; they are marked
 * "not appraised" with that note. Verify at nice.org.uk and with the treating team before relying on a row.

In England the old 'two-week wait' target was replaced in October 2023 by three standards: the 28-day Faster Diagnosis Standard (told you have or do not have cancer within 28 days of referral or screening; target 75%, rising to 80% by March 2026), the 31-day standard (treatment within a month of the decision to treat; 96%), and the 62-day standard (first treatment within 62 days of urgent referral, screening or consultant upgrade; 85%). Performance is published monthly and many trusts miss the 62-day target, so ask your cancer nurse specialist where you are on the pathway. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland publish their own 31- and 62-day figures. Emergency presentations (via A&E) account for roughly a fifth of diagnoses and have worse outcomes.",

If NICE says yes, the NHS must fund it within three months. Almost all recent yes decisions depend on a confidential discount.",
    detail: "NICE runs a single technology appraisal (TA) for each new medicine and indication, usually in parallel with licensing so guidance lands within a few months of MHRA approval. The company submits a cost-effectiveness model; an independent evidence review group critiques it; a committee decides. NICE normally accepts treatments below £20,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and needs strong justification between £20,000 and £30,000. Until 2022 an 'end-of-life' rule let drugs for people with under 24 months to live and a gain of 3+ months be accepted up to about £50,000 per QALY. The 2022 methods update replaced it with a severity modifier that weights QALYs by 1.2 or 1.7 for conditions with large absolute and proportional health loss; this catches most advanced cancers but not all, which is why some drugs for earlier-stage or HER2-low disease have been rejected. Outcomes are: recommended; recommended with optimisation (a narrower population, a stopping rule, or a Patient Access Scheme discount); recommended for the Cancer Drugs Fund; or not recommended. NHS England must fund positive TAs within 90 days. Wales and Northern Ireland adopt NICE TAs; Scotland uses the SMC instead.",

    plain: "When NICE thinks a cancer drug is promising but the evidence is not yet good enough to say yes, it can be funded from the Cancer Drugs Fund for about two years while more data are collected, then re-decided. Patients get it straight away; the company carries the financial risk.",
    detail: "The original CDF (2010-2016) paid for drugs NICE had rejected and overspent badly. Since July 2016 it has been a managed access fund run jointly by NICE and NHS England with a fixed budget (£340 million a year). A drug enters the CDF when NICE judges it has plausible potential to be cost-effective but material uncertainty; a managed access agreement sets the data to be collected (often from SACT, the national chemotherapy dataset, plus the ongoing trial) and a confidential price. Interim funding from the CDF starts from the point of positive draft guidance, so CDF drugs are often available in England before anywhere else in Europe. At the end of the period NICE reappraises and either moves the drug to routine commissioning or, occasionally, withdraws it for new patients (existing patients continue). Well over a hundred drug-indication pairs have passed through, including CAR-T therapies, osimertinib, durvalumab and pembrolizumab combinations. The live CDF list is published by NHS England and updated monthly.",

High-energy proton beam therapy opened at The Christie (Manchester, 2018) and UCLH (London, 2021); indications are mainly paediatric and young adult tumours, base-of-skull chordoma and selected head and neck and spinal tumours, decided by a national proton panel, with overseas referral no longer routine. Stereotactic radiosurgery and stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) are commissioned at designated centres for brain metastases, vestibular schwannoma, early lung cancer and oligometastatic disease under national clinical commissioning policies.

The New Medicines Fund (funded from pharmaceutical rebates) reimburses health boards for these medicines. Where SMC has not accepted a medicine, a clinician can apply under the Peer Approved Clinical System: PACS Tier 1 for ultra-orphan drugs and PACS Tier 2 (which replaced Individual Patient Treatment Requests in 2018) for any drug the SMC has rejected or not appraised.

Lung: the Targeted Lung Health Check programme (low-dose CT for people aged 55-74 who smoke or used to, identified via GP records) is being rolled out across England as the national NHS Lung Cancer Screening Programme, with full coverage planned by 2029; it has raised the share of lung cancers found at stage I-II to roughly three-quarters in screened areas.

Private medical insurance typically covers licensed cancer drugs regardless of NICE status, subject to policy limits, and a growing share of new drugs are first used in the UK in the private sector. Self-funding costs are high: a year of a modern immunotherapy or ADC at list price is often £50,000 to £150,000, though some companies offer patient access schemes. Private hospital groups offer proton therapy, tumour treating fields and drugs NICE has rejected. A private consultation for a second opinion or a specific test can be followed by an NHS referral back; NHS consultants will accept privately obtained scans and genomics.
