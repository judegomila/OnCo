/**
 * EMA register wave 5 (September 2026, docs/CONTENT-ROADMAP.md): the products in the EMA human-medicines register with
 * a cancer or cancer-care indication whose INN matched no drug record (public/regional/candidates.json, "not-in-corpus",
 * register generated 16 September 2026), re-read on the live EPAR pages on 22 September 2026.
 *
 * Every fact here comes from the EMA product page named in `links` (INN, brand, marketing authorisation holder or
 * applicant, authorisation date, opinion, indication wording) or from the OnCo records linked. US status is not
 * recorded because no US source was consulted in this wave. Regional rows live in src/data/regional-approvals.ts.
 *
 * Of the twelve INNs the measure listed, seven are written here. Three were matching faults fixed by aliases on the
 * existing records: piflufolastat (18F) is `pylarify` (EU brand Pylclari), abiraterone is `abiraterone` (Zytiga) and
 * catequentinib is `anlotinib` (Qezzaqar, CHMP negative opinion 23 July 2026). Vedolizumab (Entyvio) matched the
 * measure's oncology filter on "tumour necrosis factor" and is not a cancer medicine; the filter now excludes that
 * phrase. Human normal immunoglobulin appears twice in the register (Privigen "IVIg" and Kiovig) and is one record.
 *
 * Supportive-care products (fentanyl, epoetin theta, immunoglobulin) follow the precedent of epoetin alfa, darbepoetin
 * and the other "supportive"-tagged records in drugs-approved-wave1.ts; the roadmap's owner item on supportive care
 * stands. Registered in src/data/index.ts as `drugsEmaWave`.
