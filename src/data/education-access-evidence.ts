    "summary": "An Investigational New Drug application contains nonclinical, manufacturing and clinical-protocol information for defined investigational use. Becoming effective does not establish that the product benefits a person or is approved for marketing, and a clinical hold can prevent use. A New Drug Application or Biologics License Application instead requests marketing authorization. Submission, acceptance for filing, an application becoming effective and a marketing decision are different events. The applicable route and product version matter.",
    "notes": ["For an ordinary new IND, FDA describes a 30-calendar-day period after receipt before an investigation may begin, unless FDA gives earlier notification or imposes a hold. Expanded-access INDs and protocols have route-specific rules; no application number establishes a treatment start date.","Product identity matters alongside the proposed use. A redesigned cell product or personalised formulation cannot acquire another product's evidence or authorisation merely by sharing a target, ingredient category or platform name. FDA assesses nonclinical, manufacturing and clinical-protocol information for the proposed investigation. Ask whether the cited data and permission actually cover that product version and plan; a supplier's earlier authorisation is not itself permission for a different use."],

    "tldr": "A trial search identifies studies to examine. The study team must separately check the relevant site, cohort and full eligibility requirements.",
    "summary": "NCI describes finding a study, discussing it with the team, informed consent and formal screening as distinct steps. A registry identifier helps distinguish studies, while the dated protocol and record describe the design and entry rules. Overall recruiting status can reflect an open facility elsewhere; it does not establish an available place in the relevant local cohort. A matching diagnosis or biomarker is only part of eligibility. Medical-history review and required tests can still exclude participation after an initial discussion.",
    "notes": ["Search with disease, treatment setting, intervention aliases, biomarker and location terms. Keep registry verification and update dates with the result; ask the team about the current protocol, site and cohort. A record or invitation to screen is not a promise of enrollment.","Estimated enrollment is a target total, while actual enrollment records people already enrolled. Neither is a count of places available now. Overall study recruitment, an individual facility’s status and availability in the relevant cohort or dose group require separate dated checks.","When a protocol randomizes participants, meeting its entry rules does not reserve the experimental arm. Assignment follows the protocol’s chance process rather than a choice by the participant or doctor. Screening, eligibility, enrollment, arm assignment and individual benefit are different steps; a plausible match or invitation to screen does not establish the later steps.","Keep a compact screening record: registry number and title, current protocol version, disease and stage, treatment goal and required biomarker. Ask about previous treatments, relevant conditions and safety history, current medicines, laboratory criteria and required samples. Advanced-disease and postoperative studies can share a biomarker while requiring different measurable disease, pathology or enrolment windows. A washout is the interval defined by that protocol after a named treatment or medicine; its starting event and duration must be checked with the treating and study teams. A deadline or a half-life calculation is not permission to change treatment.","Confirm the relevant site, cohort and slot, each assignment group and the randomisation ratio, screening and visit dates, treatment duration and follow-up. Check travel, sample needs, available support and who pays. Record who supplied each dated answer and what remains unknown; request the current protocol or consent material and clarify discrepancies between it, the registry and the site. A personal eligibility worksheet prepares that discussion and does not replace formal screening.","In a fictional postoperative study, a matching molecular report is a reason to ask about screening, not proof of pathology, treatment-history, local availability or timing eligibility. If Drug B plus standard care is randomised against standard care alone, either group can be assigned; neither the doctor nor participant chooses the experimental arm. If a multicohort registry says recruiting but the local breast cohort has no slots, access is unconfirmed. Asking about another site or reopening supplies a next question, not a promise. Trial phase describes the research question rather than an individual benefit estimate."],
