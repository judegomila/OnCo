  burden: "Around one to two new cases per 100,000 people a year, with a second peak in women in their thirties; life expectancy is close to normal for most, and the risks are clots, bleeding and slow progression to myelofibrosis.",
  tldr: "Essential thrombocythaemia is a slow blood cancer in which the marrow makes too many platelets. Most people need only aspirin and monitoring; those at higher risk of clots take a drug to lower the platelet count, usually hydroxyurea or interferon, with anagrelide in reserve.",
  summary: "Essential thrombocythaemia is a classical myeloproliferative neoplasm defined by a sustained platelet count above 450 x 10^9/L with a marrow full of large, mature megakaryocytes and no other explanation. About 60 percent carry JAK2 V617F, 20 to 25 percent a CALR mutation and 3 to 5 percent an MPL mutation; the rest are triple negative. Many people have no symptoms and are found on a routine blood count; others have headaches, visual disturbance, burning red hands and feet (erythromelalgia) or, at high platelet counts, paradoxical bleeding. Treatment is set by the IPSET-thrombosis score, which weighs age, prior clot, JAK2 status and cardiovascular risk: very low-risk patients may need nothing, low-risk patients take low-dose aspirin, and high-risk patients add cytoreduction with hydroxyurea or interferon, with anagrelide second line. The PT-1 trial showed hydroxyurea plus aspirin beats anagrelide plus aspirin on arterial clots and bleeding. Progression to myelofibrosis happens in a minority over decades and to acute leukaemia in a few percent. Bomedemstat, an LSD1 inhibitor, is in a phase 3 trial against hydroxyurea, and antibodies against mutant CALR are the first treatments aimed at the clone itself.",

  summary: "In the myeloproliferative neoplasms, low-dose aspirin is given to almost everyone with polycythaemia vera and to low-risk and high-risk essential thrombocythaemia, because activated platelets cause both the microvascular symptoms (erythromelalgia, headache) and the arterial clots that drive mortality; the ECLAP trial in polycythaemia vera showed fewer combined cardiovascular events with aspirin. In prevention, the CAPP2 trial in Lynch syndrome found that 600 mg of aspirin a day for at least two years roughly halved colorectal cancers over the following decade, and long-term follow-up of cardiovascular trials suggested fewer colorectal cancer deaths. Against that, ASPREE, a trial in healthy adults over 70, found more cancer deaths on aspirin than placebo, so aspirin is not recommended for cancer prevention in older people without a specific indication. The Add-Aspirin trial is testing aspirin after treatment for breast, colorectal, gastro-oesophageal and prostate cancer. Its harms are bleeding, especially in the gut, and it must be avoided in essential thrombocythaemia with acquired von Willebrand deficiency.",
