/**
 * Maps OnCo cancer ids to GLOBOCAN 2022 cancer codes (see public/globocan/countries.json → cancers).
 *
 * GLOBOCAN reports by anatomical site (ICD-10), not by molecular subtype or histology, so several OnCo
 * cancers share one site total and a few have no direct estimate at all. Every such case is stated in
 * `note` and surfaced on the page as a data gap rather than silently approximated.
 *
 *  codes: one code, or several codes that are summed (mutually exclusive ICD ranges, so counts and
 *         age-standardised rates add; cumulative risk does not and is left blank for sums).
 *  shared: true when the site total is shared with other OnCo cancers (subtype split unavailable).
