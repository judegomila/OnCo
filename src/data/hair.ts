 * HAIR: WHAT TREATMENT TAKES, WHAT COMES BACK, AND WHAT HELPS. Facts checked 2 October 2026.
 *
 * The deep layer behind /live/hair/. The corpus already holds scalp cooling (technologies.ts), minoxidil for
 * persistent and endocrine-therapy thinning, bimatoprost for lashes and wigs and cranial prostheses
 * (complementary.ts), so nothing here repeats them: this file adds the records those four did not cover.
 *
 *  - Six glossary terms for the things that happen, which patients are least warned about: anagen effluvium
 *    (why it falls out and why it comes back), the regrowth that is a different texture and colour, loss of
 *    eyebrows and eyelashes, persistent chemotherapy-induced alopecia, endocrine-therapy-induced alopecia and
 *    persistent radiation-induced alopecia.
 *  - Seven graded approaches people are offered or sold, each tagged `evidence:<grade>` on the model in
 *    src/lib/complementary.ts and entered in COMPLEMENTARY_INDEX: scalp care, camouflage and restoration,
 *    platelet-rich plasma, low-level light, the antiandrogens, the supplements, and the creams that were
 *    trialled to prevent loss and did not. Where there is no reliable human evidence the grade is
 *    `insufficient` and the record says so; where trials were run and found nothing it is `no-benefit`. They
 *    are here because a reader who finds nothing finds the advertisement instead.
 *
 * Two things this file is careful not to say, both checked on 2 October 2026. There is no completed Cochrane
 * review of scalp cooling: CD016196 is a protocol with no results. And neither MASCC nor ASCO has a guideline
 * on alopecia; the ESMO 2021 dermatological toxicities guideline is the only one, and it is named rather than
 * folded into "the guidelines".
 *
 * Every number is the number the linked primary source states, checked against the abstract or the page itself.
 * Where a source gives no number, none is given. British spelling, no em-dashes.

    summary: "Most scalp follicles are in anagen, the growing phase, at any one time, and the matrix cells at the base of a growing follicle divide faster than almost any other cell in the body. A drug that kills dividing cells therefore hits them hard: the hair shaft narrows where growth stopped, breaks at that point, and the hair falls as a crop rather than gradually. That is anagen effluvium, and the two to three week delay is the time it takes the weakened shaft to reach the surface. It is distinct from telogen effluvium, the slower, partial shedding that follows surgery, severe illness, anaesthesia or weight loss and which many people also have after a cancer diagnosis. Because the stem cells in the bulge of the follicle are usually spared, regrowth begins within weeks of the last dose in most people. Where those stem cells are damaged, by high cumulative taxane exposure or by transplant conditioning, regrowth is incomplete and the result is persistent chemotherapy-induced alopecia. Scalp cooling works on this mechanism by narrowing scalp vessels while drug levels in the blood are highest.",

    summary: "The National Cancer Institute's guidance says hair often grows back two to three months after chemotherapy ends, that it is very fine at first, and that it can be curlier or straighter, or even a different colour, before returning in time to how it was. The curl that gives the change its popular name comes from the follicle regenerating with a different shaft shape; the colour change comes from pigment cells in the follicle recovering more slowly than the keratin-producing cells, so the first growth can be grey or white before pigment returns. Order matters: scalp hair usually returns first, then eyebrows and eyelashes, then body hair, over roughly six to twelve months. Colouring and perming are usually deferred until the new hair is a few centimetres long and the scalp is no longer tender, with a patch test first, because new hair is finer and the scalp is more easily irritated. If density has not recovered a year after the last dose, that is the point at which a dermatology referral is worth asking for, because persistent chemotherapy-induced alopecia is a recognised diagnosis with treatment options and because easily corrected causes such as iron deficiency and thyroid disease should be excluded.",

    summary: "Brow and lash follicles spend a much shorter share of their cycle in the growing phase than scalp follicles do, so they are hit later in a course of chemotherapy and often only partly. Losing them changes the face more than the loss of scalp hair does, and it removes a mechanical defence: without lashes the eye collects dust and grit, and without brows sweat runs into the eyes. Practical measures are wraparound glasses outdoors, preservative-free artificial tears, and brow pencils, powders and stencils, which the Look Good Feel Better workshops teach free of charge. Bimatoprost, a prostaglandin analogue drop approved for thin lashes, has randomised evidence including a cohort who had finished chemotherapy; eyebrow use is off-label and less well studied. Semi-permanent tattooing and microblading of brows are usually deferred until blood counts have recovered and done by a practitioner told about the treatment, because of infection risk. A separate and opposite problem belongs here: epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors such as erlotinib and osimertinib can make eyelashes grow abnormally long and stiff (trichomegaly) so that they scratch the eye, which an optometrist or ophthalmologist trims.",

    summary: "Persistent, sometimes called permanent, chemotherapy-induced alopecia is incomplete regrowth that lasts beyond six months after the last dose. In a prospective Korean cohort of 61 women with breast cancer whose hair density and thickness were measured before chemotherapy and who were followed for three years (Kang et al., The Oncologist 2019), 39.5 per cent met the definition at six months and 42.3 per cent at three years; those who had a taxane-based regimen were more likely to be affected, and at three years the problems participants reported were hair thinning (75.0 per cent), reduced hair volume (53.9 per cent), hair loss (34.6 per cent) and grey hair (34.6 per cent). That figure comes from a single-centre cohort of 61 people and should be read as what careful measurement finds rather than as a population rate; clinic series that count only those who seek help report far less.\n\nIn the largest treated series, a retrospective cohort of 192 women across three centres (Freites-Martinez et al., JAMA Dermatology 2019), 98 had persistent chemotherapy-induced alopecia and taxanes were the agent involved in 80 of them (82 per cent). Compared with women whose thinning came from endocrine therapy, their alopecia was more often diffuse (41 per cent versus 25 per cent) and more often graded moderate (39 per cent versus 13 per cent). After treatment with topical minoxidil or spironolactone, moderate to significant improvement was seen in 36 of 54 patients (67 per cent). High-dose conditioning for stem cell transplantation, particularly busulfan-containing regimens, is the other recognised cause.\n\nWhat to do about it is well enough established to be worth asking for and not well enough established to promise: a dermatology referral to exclude iron deficiency, thyroid disease and the pattern hair loss that many people would have developed anyway; topical minoxidil, with the series above behind it; and camouflage. Scalp cooling, which reduces the dose reaching the follicle, is being examined as a way of reducing the risk, but no trial has yet reported persistent alopecia as a primary endpoint.",

    tldr: "Gradual thinning at the parting and crown that builds over months on tamoxifen, an aromatase inhibitor or ovarian suppression. It is not the sudden shedding of chemotherapy, it lasts as long as the treatment does, and it is often dismissed because it is mild on a clinician's scale and not on the patient's.",
    summary: "In the series that first described it systematically, 112 women with breast cancer seen at a dermatology service for hair loss on endocrine therapy (Freites-Martinez et al., JAMA Dermatology 2018), the alopecia was attributed to an aromatase inhibitor in 75 (67 per cent) and to tamoxifen in 37 (33 per cent). The pattern was that of androgenetic alopecia: widening of the parting, thinning at the crown, miniaturised hairs on trichoscopy, rather than the diffuse shedding of chemotherapy. Severity was graded 1, the mildest band, in 96 of 104 patients (92 per cent). The quality-of-life measurement is the point of the paper: despite that mildness the Hairdex emotion score was 41.8 (standard deviation 21.3), a significant negative effect, which is the gap between how the problem is scored in clinic and how it is lived.\n\nAfter topical minoxidil, moderate or significant improvement was observed in 37 of 46 patients (80 per cent). In the later three-centre cohort (JAMA Dermatology 2019), 32 of 42 women with endocrine-therapy alopecia (76 per cent) improved moderately or significantly on topical minoxidil or spironolactone. These are uncontrolled series in people who sought dermatological help, not randomised trials, and some improvement over months would be expected without treatment.\n\nThe decision that matters more than any of this is adherence. Five years of adjuvant endocrine therapy substantially reduces recurrence and death from hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer, and stopping it to protect hair trades a visible problem for an invisible one. Switching between tamoxifen and an aromatase inhibitor, or between aromatase inhibitors, is a conversation to have with the oncologist rather than a decision to make alone. Scalp cooling has no role here: the drug is taken daily for years, not infused over hours.",

    tldr: "Radiotherapy takes hair only where the beam passes through the scalp, and whether it returns depends on the dose the follicles received. Below a threshold it regrows in months; above it, the patch can stay thin for good.",
    summary: "Radiation alopecia is local, not systemic: hair falls from the area the beam enters and leaves, beginning two to three weeks into treatment. The National Cancer Institute's guidance says hair often grows back three to six months after radiotherapy ends, and that after a very high dose it may grow back thinner or not at all in the treated area.\n\nThe dose relationship has been measured twice. Lawenda and colleagues (2004) scored 61 scalp regions in 26 patients after cranial irradiation and found that permanent alopecia correlated with the calculated follicle dose and with nothing else they tested, not age, sex, family history of baldness, smoking, diabetes or beam energy. In a later cohort of 71 children and adults treated for central nervous system tumours or head and neck sarcoma (Phillips et al., JAMA Dermatology 2020), the median estimated scalp dose was 39.6 Gy and the dose at which half of patients were estimated to have moderate (grade 2) alopecia was 36.1 Gy (95 per cent confidence interval 33.7 to 39.6 Gy); higher dose and proton irradiation were each associated with greater severity. Of 34 patients treated with topical minoxidil 5 per cent, 28 (82 per cent) responded, and a small number were helped by hair transplantation or surgical reconstruction.\n\nThe practical consequence is a question for the radiotherapy planning team rather than a treatment: what dose does this plan deliver to the scalp, and can the beam arrangement reduce it without compromising the tumour. Scalp-sparing intensity-modulated planning is used where tumour position allows.",

    summary: "The National Cancer Institute's guidance for people losing hair to cancer treatment is specific and worth following literally: treat the hair gently, with a soft-bristled brush or wide-tooth comb; wash with a mild shampoo, less often and gently, patting dry with a soft towel; avoid hair dryers, irons, gels and clips that can hurt the scalp; use sunscreen or a hat outdoors; keep the head warm with a comfortable covering; and use lotion or conditioner if the scalp itches or feels tender. Some people cut their hair short before it starts to fall so the change is less abrupt, and those who shave are advised to use an electric shaver rather than a blade. During radiotherapy to the head the same gentleness applies to irradiated skin, which is more fragile than it looks and should be washed with lukewarm water and a mild soap rather than scrubbed.\n\nWhen hair starts to grow back, the same source asks for gentleness again: less brushing, curling and blow-drying, and less frequent washing. Colouring and perming are generally left until the new hair is a few centimetres long and the scalp is comfortable, with a patch test first, because new growth is finer and the skin beneath it is more reactive. None of this has been through a randomised trial, which is why the grade here is moderate rather than strong: it is consistent advice from the cancer institutes and from dermatology practice, resting on the physiology of a scalp with no hair on it, not on a controlled comparison.",

Keratin fibres and scalp micropigmentation are cheap, immediate and reversible; hair transplantation and surgical reconstruction have been reported in cancer survivors only in small numbers, and no trial compares any of them.",
    summary: "This record covers what is left after minoxidil: concealment and surgery. Keratin or cotton hair-building fibres cling to existing hairs electrostatically and make a thin area read as dense in ordinary light; they wash out, cost little and carry no medical risk beyond the obvious one of a wet day. Scalp micropigmentation tattoos pigment into the scalp to imitate shaved stubble or to reduce the contrast between scalp and hair; it is semi-permanent, needs a practitioner who has been told the medical history, and fades over years. Partial hairpieces, toppers and integration pieces sit between fibres and a full wig and suit a patch of loss, which is the usual pattern after radiotherapy.\n\nSurgical hair restoration in people treated for cancer is reported, but thinly. In the largest published series of persistent radiation-induced alopecia, 71 patients, two responded to hair transplantation and one to plastic surgical reconstruction; those are case numbers, not an evidence base. Transplantation moves follicles from the back of the scalp, which is spared in pattern hair loss but not necessarily spared by chemotherapy or by a radiation field, so whether donor hair will survive is a question for a surgeon who understands what the treatment did. Nothing here has a randomised trial behind it in any population with cancer, which is why the grade is insufficient: not that these do not work, but that nobody has measured them in this setting.",
    principle: "Concealment changes what light does at the scalp, by adding fibre to existing shafts or pigment to bare skin. Restoration moves follicles from an area that still grows into one that does not, and depends on the donor area having been spared.",

    tldr: "Blood is spun to concentrate platelets and injected into the scalp. It is sold widely for hair loss and is expensive. The one randomised study in people treated for cancer injected one half of the scalp and left the other half alone: both halves improved by the same amount.",
    summary: "Platelet-rich plasma is autologous: the patient's blood is centrifuged, the platelet-rich fraction separated, and injected into the scalp, on the reasoning that the growth factors platelets release stimulate follicles. It is offered by dermatology and cosmetic clinics at a price, usually as a course of sessions, and most of the evidence behind those offers comes from androgenetic alopecia rather than from cancer.\n\nUntil recently there was no evidence at all in this group: the 2019 review of hair disorders in cancer survivors stated plainly that there was no reported experience of using platelet-rich plasma to treat alopecia in survivors and that costs may be high. That changed with a single-centre randomised controlled pilot (Rossi et al., Dermatologic Surgery 2026), which enrolled 27 patients, 15 with endocrine-induced alopecia and 12 with persistent chemotherapy-induced alopecia, and used a split-scalp design, treating one side and leaving the other as the control. Global assessment improved by 1.2 points from baseline at week 12 on both the treated and the untreated side, with no significant difference between them. Hair density rose on both sides, by 21 and 16 hairs per square centimetre, again with no significant difference. Quality of life did not improve. Adverse events were grade 1 to grade 3 scalp pain. The authors note that plasma injected into one side may diffuse to the other, which would blunt a real difference, so the result is not proof that it does nothing.\n\nOne finding in that study belongs on a patient page: in 2 of 12 circulating tumour cell assays, malignant cells were detected in the platelet-rich plasma itself. No tumour seeding was observed, and the number is tiny, but anyone considering injecting their own concentrated blood into their scalp after cancer should know it was looked for and found. The grade here is insufficient because the only controlled study in this population is a pilot of 27 people that did not separate treated from untreated scalp, not because the approach has been shown to fail.",

    summary: "Photobiomodulation delivers non-thermal red or near-infrared light to stimulate mitochondrial activity in the tissue beneath. It has strong evidence in oncology for one thing, oral mucositis, where the MASCC and ISOO guidelines recommend it with specified parameters. Hair is a different question, and the two randomised trials in breast cancer come to different-looking conclusions for different reasons.\n\nThe HAIRLASER trial (Lodewijckx et al., Supportive Care in Cancer 2023) randomised 32 women who had finished anthracycline and taxane chemotherapy to photobiomodulation three times a week for twelve weeks or to no intervention, and reported higher patient-rated hair scores in the treated group one month after chemotherapy. The control arm received nothing at all, with no sham device, so expectation is not separated from effect. The second trial (Claes et al., Lasers in Medical Science 2025) asked the question that matters for prevention: 29 patients on taxane-based chemotherapy received either photobiomodulation plus scalp cooling or scalp cooling alone. Scalp coverage and hair thickness did not differ between the groups, and the authors concluded that adding light did not increase the efficacy of cooling, although quality-of-life scores were higher in the group that received it.\n\nThe safety point is worth stating because it is specific to cancer and absent from the marketing. The MASCC and ISOO mucositis guideline, which recommends photobiomodulation for the mouth, also records that animal data on how light affects tumour behaviour are conflicting and advises clinicians to inform patients of expected benefits and potential risks before treating a region where a tumour is or may be. For the scalp that matters most to people treated for a brain tumour, a scalp cancer or a cancer that can spread to the scalp. The grade is insufficient: two small trials, one without a sham arm and one showing no addition to cooling.",

    tldr: "Because hair thinning on endocrine therapy follows the pattern of androgenetic alopecia, the drugs used for that pattern are sometimes added. The evidence in cancer survivors cannot separate them from minoxidil, the one guideline that addresses spironolactone says not to use it routinely, and an expert panel advised against finasteride and dutasteride in breast cancer.",
    summary: "Endocrine therapy lowers oestrogen, which shifts the balance of signals at the follicle towards androgen effects, so the thinning it causes looks like female pattern hair loss. That reasoning is why spironolactone, an aldosterone antagonist with antiandrogen activity, and the 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors finasteride and dutasteride are sometimes prescribed to survivors. The reasoning is sound; the evidence is not there yet, and the guidance points the other way.\n\nOn efficacy, there is one number and it cannot be attributed. In the three-centre cohort of 192 women (JAMA Dermatology 2019), moderate to significant improvement after topical minoxidil or spironolactone was seen in 67 per cent of those with persistent chemotherapy alopecia and 76 per cent of those with endocrine-therapy alopecia; the two drugs are reported together and no part of that belongs to spironolactone alone. No randomised trial of any antiandrogen for cancer-related alopecia exists.\n\nOn safety, a systematic review of 47 studies (Rozner et al., Breast Cancer Research and Treatment 2019) found no evidence of interaction between 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors or spironolactone and the endocrine therapies used in breast cancer, and no consistent evidence of increased breast cancer risk with spironolactone across three studies covering 49,298 patients. It also found that oestrogen levels rose in a minority of women on each drug class, and that the risk of breast cancer with 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors has not been studied. Its conclusion was that spironolactone may be considered for further research, which is not the same as recommending it.\n\nTwo formal positions disagree with prescribing. The ESMO clinical practice guideline on dermatological toxicities states that spironolactone is not recommended because the risk and benefit analysis does not justify its routine use. A 2025 international Delphi consensus of fifteen experts on persistent chemotherapy-induced alopecia emphasised prevention by scalp cooling and early topical or low-dose oral minoxidil, and specifically did not recommend bicalutamide, oral finasteride or dutasteride for breast cancer patients, citing safety concerns. A dermatologist may still reach a different decision for an individual, and that is a conversation to have with the oncologist in the room.",

No randomised trial of any of them has been run in chemotherapy or endocrine-therapy hair loss. High-dose biotin also distorts hospital blood tests, including the one used to diagnose a heart attack.",
    summary: "Search for hair regrowth after chemotherapy and the results are mostly products. The honest position is short: there is no randomised evidence that any oral supplement helps hair loss caused by cancer treatment, because no such trial has been run. The nearest evidence is in general hair loss rather than in cancer. A 2026 systematic review and meta-analysis of 14 studies and 967 adults with alopecia or hair thinning, testing commercial supplements (Ceramosides, Nutrafol, Nourkrin, Lambdapil, Viviscal, Forti5, Cynatine HNS and others) found a reduction in resting-phase hair density and an increase in growing-phase density, but no significant difference in total hair count, and its authors called for rigorous independent research; many of the underlying trials were funded by the companies selling the products. For biotin specifically, a review found 18 reported cases of its use for hair and nail changes, all in people with an underlying cause of poor growth, and concluded that there is not enough evidence for supplementation in healthy people.\n\nThe only guideline to address this says the same thing gently: the ESMO guideline on dermatological toxicities suggests checking thyroid-stimulating hormone, vitamin D, zinc and ferritin and correcting a deficiency if there is one, and says biotin or orthosilicic acid can be considered as an initial treatment but are not generally recommended. Correcting a measured deficiency is a different matter from taking a supplement because the label mentions hair.\n\nThe reason to grade this rather than ignore it is a specific harm. The United States Food and Drug Administration warned in 2017, and again in 2019, that biotin in a blood sample can cause clinically significant incorrect test results, and singled out troponin, the marker used to diagnose a heart attack: before the 2017 communication it had received a report of one patient taking high levels of biotin who died after a falsely low troponin result. The 2019 update says many dietary supplements promoted for hair, skin and nail benefits contain biotin at up to 650 times the recommended daily intake, that the FDA is aware of many containing 20 mg and some up to 100 mg per pill with instructions to take several a day, and that there is not enough information to know whether stopping biotin for any number of hours before a test prevents the error. Both communications have since been taken off the FDA website and are linked here through the web archive; the FDA's live page on assays subject to biotin interference says it continues to receive reports of falsely low troponin results. People on cancer treatment have frequent blood tests and a raised risk of cardiac events, which is why this belongs on this page and not in a footnote. Tell the team what you take.",
    principle: "Biotin is a cofactor for carboxylase enzymes and a true deficiency causes hair and nail changes, which is the kernel of truth the marketing is built on. The interference with laboratory tests is chemical rather than biological: many immunoassays use a biotin and streptavidin binding step, and excess biotin in the sample competes with it.",

    summary: "This record exists so that the question is answered rather than left open, because it is the first thing people ask and the answer is unwelcome. A meta-analysis of interventions to prevent chemotherapy-induced alopecia (Shin et al., International Journal of Cancer 2015) pooled 8 randomised and 9 controlled trials covering 1,098 participants. Scalp cooling significantly reduced the risk of alopecia, with a relative risk of 0.38 (95 per cent confidence interval 0.32 to 0.45); topical 2 per cent minoxidil and the other interventions tested did not significantly reduce it.\n\nThe individual failures are worth naming. Topical minoxidil was tested for prevention in a randomised trial of 48 women receiving doxorubicin (Rodriguez et al., Annals of Oncology 1994): 88 per cent and 92 per cent of patients in the two arms had severe alopecia, a difference that was not significant. Topical calcipotriol, a vitamin D analogue that protects rodent hair follicles, was tested in a randomised controlled trial in women receiving CMF chemotherapy (Bleiker et al., British Journal of Dermatology 2005) and had no detectable effect on any measure: the proportion with minimal hair loss, shed rates, plucked telogen and fractured hair counts, the shape of shed and plucked hair, regrowth or hair density. An earlier phase 1 study of topical calcitriol found that all 14 patients developed moderate alopecia and that eight developed a toxic rash where the drug had been applied.\n\nNewer topical calcitriol formulations reached phase 1 in taxane-treated patients and were reported as safe, with alopecia of less than 50 per cent in 8 of 23 patients at week 7, but no phase 2 or phase 3 trial of it has been registered. AS101, a tellurium compound, prevented alopecia as an incidental finding in a 44-patient trial designed to test marrow protection, and no trial of it for hair has been registered since. The practical conclusion for a reader is that minoxidil is a treatment for hair that is slow to return, not a shield for hair you still have, and that the only prevention with a regulator behind it is cooling.",
    principle: "Each of these aimed to make the follicle temporarily less vulnerable, by pushing it out of the dividing phase or by local cell-cycle arrest, so that a drug circulating in the blood would do it less damage. Scalp cooling takes the other route, reducing how much of the drug arrives.",
