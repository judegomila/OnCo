    summary: "Oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma arises in the tonsils, base of tongue, soft palate and pharyngeal wall. In North America and Europe most cases are now caused by HPV type 16 and are staged separately because they carry a far better outlook than tobacco-related, HPV-negative tumours, which are more often p53-mutant and resistant. Standard treatment is cisplatin chemoradiation, or transoral robotic surgery with neck dissection and adjuvant treatment for smaller tumours; cetuximab proved inferior to cisplatin in HPV-positive disease in RTOG 1016 and De-ESCALaTE. Trials are testing lower radiotherapy doses, fewer drugs and circulating HPV DNA to guide de-escalation in HPV-positive patients, while HPV vaccination is expected to prevent most future cases. Recurrent or metastatic disease is treated with pembrolizumab, alone or with chemotherapy, on KEYNOTE-048.",

    summary: "Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma arises in the glottis (vocal cords), supraglottis or subglottis; hypopharyngeal cancer arises just behind and below and is grouped with it. Persistent hoarseness leads to early diagnosis of glottic tumours, which are treated with transoral laser microsurgery or radiotherapy alone with excellent cure rates. Locally advanced disease is treated with concurrent cisplatin chemoradiation, established by RTOG 91-11 as the best way to keep the larynx, while tumours that have destroyed cartilage or the larynx's function are best treated with total laryngectomy and postoperative radiotherapy, followed by voice rehabilitation with a voice prosthesis. Hypopharyngeal cancer presents late, with swallowing difficulty and neck nodes, and often needs laryngopharyngectomy. Smoking cessation is the most important single intervention.",

    summary: "Oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma arises on the tongue, floor of mouth, gums, buccal mucosa, palate and lips, often from a white or red patch (leukoplakia or erythroplakia). Unlike oropharyngeal cancer it is rarely HPV-driven; tobacco, alcohol and, in South and South-East Asia, betel quid with areca nut are the causes, and a screening trial in Kerala showed that visual inspection by trained health workers reduces mouth cancer deaths in high-risk people. Treatment is surgical resection with neck dissection and free-flap reconstruction, with postoperative radiotherapy or cisplatin chemoradiation for advanced stage, positive margins or nodal spread with extranodal extension. Depth of invasion now determines stage and the need to treat the neck. Recurrent or metastatic disease is treated as for other head and neck cancers with pembrolizumab-based therapy, and metronomic methotrexate-celecoxib from Tata Memorial Hospital offers a low-cost option.",
