    burden: "About three quarters of kidney cancers and most of the deaths; a third of patients present with or develop metastases, and immunotherapy combinations have lifted median survival in advanced disease to around four years.",
    tldr: "Clear cell is the common kidney cancer, driven by loss of the VHL gene that leaves the tumour behaving as if starved of oxygen and flooding itself with blood vessels. That biology explains why anti-angiogenic drugs, immunotherapy and the HIF-2 alpha blocker belzutifan all work.",
    summary: "Clear cell renal cell carcinoma arises from the proximal tubule and in about nine in ten cases has lost the VHL gene on chromosome 3p, stabilising HIF-2 alpha and driving VEGF, so tumours are highly vascular; PBRM1, SETD2 and BAP1 mutations shape its behaviour. Small tumours are removed by partial nephrectomy or ablated, and some are watched. Adjuvant pembrolizumab after nephrectomy improves survival in higher-risk disease (KEYNOTE-564). Metastatic disease is treated first line with an immunotherapy doublet: pembrolizumab with axitinib or lenvatinib, nivolumab with cabozantinib, or nivolumab with ipilimumab for intermediate- and poor-risk patients; cabozantinib, axitinib, tivozanib and belzutifan follow. Belzutifan, the first HIF-2 alpha inhibitor, was approved for VHL disease in 2021 and for previously treated advanced disease in 2023. Cytoreductive nephrectomy is now reserved for selected patients after CARMENA.",

    summary: "Papillary renal cell carcinoma is a heterogeneous group defined by papillary architecture; the older split into type 1 and type 2 has given way to molecular groups in the WHO 2022 classification. MET alterations (mutation, amplification, chromosome 7 gain) are frequent, especially in the former type 1, and are inherited in hereditary papillary renal carcinoma. Fumarate hydratase-deficient renal cancer, from the hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer syndrome, is an aggressive form once labelled type 2. Localised tumours are treated like other kidney cancers with surgery or ablation. For metastatic disease the PAPMET trial showed cabozantinib gave longer progression-free survival and more responses than sunitinib, making it the preferred first-line option; savolitinib is active in MET-driven tumours (SAVOIR), and immunotherapy combinations have shown activity in single-arm studies.",

    tldr: "Chromophobe kidney cancer comes from a different cell of the kidney's tubules, usually behaves gently and is cured by surgery. Its rare metastatic form responds poorly to immunotherapy, so kinase and mTOR inhibitors are used, and it runs in families with Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome.",
    summary: "Chromophobe renal cell carcinoma arises from the intercalated cells of the collecting duct and is marked by loss of whole chromosomes (1, 2, 6, 10, 13, 17, 21) with TP53 and PTEN mutations in a minority; it must be told apart from the benign oncocytoma, which it resembles. It is a feature of Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome, caused by germline FLCN mutations, along with skin fibrofolliculomas and lung cysts. Most tumours are found early and cured by partial nephrectomy, and surveillance is reasonable for small lesions. Metastatic disease is uncommon, responds poorly to PD-1 blockade and is treated with sunitinib or cabozantinib, everolimus, or lenvatinib plus everolimus, drawing on the mTOR pathway activity seen in the disease; sarcomatoid transformation carries the worst prognosis of any kidney cancer.",
