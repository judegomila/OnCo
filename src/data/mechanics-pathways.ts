Carcinoma in situ (DCIS, CIN3, Barrett's dysplasia) respects the sheet; invasion requires protease-driven breach (MMP2/9/14, uPA) at invadopodia, loss of polarity (PAR3, SCRIB), integrin switching and EMT-like changes, often assisted by CAFs and macrophages that widen the gap.

  "In a fictional vaccine study, blood cells release a cytokine after added-peptide stimulation. This supports reactivity under that assay’s conditions. Added peptide can bypass natural processing, and the result does not establish entry into the sampled tumour, recognition of naturally presenting cancer cells, useful killing or clinical benefit. Antigen release is not priming, blood expansion is not infiltration, and a return arrow does not demonstrate durable protection.",
  "Use the cycle to name the measured step and the next untested dependency. A proposed bottleneck or complementary pair of mechanisms does not establish a beneficial or safe combination. Increasing a response can also affect healthy tissue; the model does not identify a safe intervention by itself."
,
"For a coding change to supply a conventional T-cell target, its information must be expressed, protein produced and processed into a fragment, that peptide displayed with HLA, and a suitable receptor able to recognise the display. DNA, RNA, protein, recovered displayed peptide and controlled recognition are separate observations. A prediction at one step does not measure all the others. This conventional alpha-beta route does not describe every T cell, antibody or natural killer recognition system.",
"An immune observation suggests a question ladder: identify the cells and their location; ask whether a proposed peptide is produced and displayed; test recognition against appropriate target and background controls; distinguish tissue entry from useful target-specific function; then seek clinical comparisons for benefit and harm. Poor display, few matching cells, failed tissue access and impaired local function are different proposed failures. A count, supplied-peptide response or plausible pathway alone cannot complete that chain. These are task-dependent interpretation questions, not a mandatory clinical test menu."

  "Tumour suppressors can restrain growth, maintain the genome or help remove damaged cells. Knudson’s retinoblastoma model proposed two events, with an inherited first event or two acquired events. Different changes can disable the useful copies, but two-hit loss is not a universal law for all suppressors. Haploinsufficiency means one useful copy supplies insufficient protective dosage; Fero’s challenged p27-heterozygous mice retained an unmutated, unsilenced remaining copy.",
  "A dominant-negative altered protein interferes with useful protein rather than merely reducing dosage. Boettcher demonstrated this for particular TP53 variants in myeloid and leukaemia models, not every TP53 variant or breast tumour. TCGA reported TP53 mutations in 80% of its basal-like breast cancers. Basal-like is not identical to all TNBC, and a genomic frequency does not establish complete functional loss, drug restoration or a current approval claim.",
  "In a fictional comparison, an overactive receptor supplies a stronger signalling readout while loss of a repair safeguard has a different functional consequence. Neither observation alone demonstrates survival dependence. Interpretation retains the specimen and exact variant or copy finding, RNA or protein consequences and controlled functional endpoints, including exposure and off-target controls. There is no generic oncogene score that substitutes for disease-specific actionability.",
  "The named examples have different evidence and mechanisms. Druker’s early CML study supports BCR-ABL-directed inhibition in its historical clinical population. Delattre’s 1992 study identified a translocation-generated hybrid transcript underlying the EWSR1-FLI1 fusion. Poulikakos used chemical-genetic cell experiments to show that the tested RAF inhibitors could activate ERK through RAF dimers in wild-type BRAF settings. The allele, intervention and endpoint matter; a driver label does not make all these alterations equally drug-sensitive."

A controlled functional effect with independent specificity tests is needed before assigning receptor dependence.\n\nMany RTKs have extracellular ligand-binding regions, membrane-spanning regions and intracellular tyrosine-kinase machinery. Families activate differently: Zhang demonstrated an asymmetric EGFR kinase-domain interaction, while Stauber examined an FGF1-FGFR2 extracellular complex with a proposed heparin-related assembly arrangement. Ligand, helper molecules, receptor member and context matter. A downstream phosphosite can have multiple upstream causes and is not a universal receptor meter.\n\nSlamon 1987 studied 189 primary breast cancers and reported HER2 amplification in 30%, associated with relapse and survival; that historical study is not a present-day universal prevalence or a causal drug-response experiment. In the 2001 randomized trial of 469 women with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer, adding trastuzumab to chemotherapy increased median survival from 20.3 to 25.1 months, with cardiac toxicity as a material risk. A trial median summarizes a group and does not predict an individual survival time.\n\nIn a fictional comparison, two cultures contain a receptor, but only the amplified, high-surface-protein culture slows growth after a blocking antibody, while receptor phosphorylation falls in both. This separates amount, sampled signaling and growth response; the pattern suggests dependence but attribution still needs controls and independent perturbation. RNA is not surface accessibility, a family-name inhibitor need not engage every member at the tested exposure, and For an antibody-drug conjugate, receptor access and payload delivery are separate questions from whether growth requires that receptor's signaling.

RNA Pol II is released from promoter-proximal pausing by P-TEFb (CDK9) and initiated by TFIIH (CDK7); CDK12/13 couple elongation to DNA-repair gene expression. MYC, itself super-enhancer-driven and amplified or ecDNA-borne, is an amplifier of all active genes. Because oncogene transcripts and proteins (MYC, MCL-1) are short-lived, transient inhibition of BET, CDK7 or CDK9 collapses them first ('transcriptional addiction').

  "Ubiquitin is a small protein attached through enzyme steps: E1 uses ATP for activation, E2 carries activated ubiquitin, and E3 promotes substrate selection and transfer. Reticulocyte experiments separated these functions. E3 families differ in transfer mechanism; no single cartoon specifies all of them.",
  "Suitable tagged cargo can be unfolded by ATP-dependent proteasomal machinery and broken into fragments, while ubiquitin is removed and reused. Other ubiquitin signals organise interactions rather than destruction, and yeast experiments show overlapping chain functions. Lysosomal autophagy and proteasomal breakdown are distinct routes.",
  "Protein abundance reflects synthesis and removal. Measure named-substrate decay over time with synthesis, handling and viability controls; restoration of an E3 adaptor can strengthen attribution without proving direct binding or global proteasome failure. Catalytic activity per time, ubiquitinated-cargo intensity and protein lifetime in hours are different readouts. KEAP1 is one CUL3 adaptor for NRF2, so a CUL3 change cannot uniquely identify that substrate. Pulse labelling or a controlled temporary synthesis block can help estimate turnover but may cause stress. Independent perturbation and restoration help distinguish a selected-substrate effect from a secondary response; enzyme engagement alone does not establish selective killing.",

    tldr: "Cells can repair breaks through both DNA strands using a matching template or several end-joining routes. The available template, cell state and broken ends affect which route can operate.",
    summary: "Double-strand breaks can be repaired through matching-template homologous recombination or several end-joining routes. Homologous repair often uses the sister chromatid after DNA copying. The substrate, available template and cell-cycle state affect which route can operate.\n\nPreparing a double-strand break for homologous repair includes DNA end resection in the 5′ to 3′ direction, leaving protruding 3′ single-stranded ends. RAD51 helps a prepared strand find and pair with a complementary strand in matching duplex DNA, displacing the other template strand into a D-loop. DNA synthesis can then extend the invading end using the template. Synthesis-dependent strand annealing can finish as a noncrossover repair: the extended strand leaves the template and pairs with the other broken end. Other homologous-repair routes can have crossover outcomes, so using an intact template does not mean every repair leaves donor and recipient arrangements unchanged. Purified bacterial RecA structures reveal strand-pairing intermediates; they are not direct measurements of human RAD51 repair in a tumour.\n\nClassical nonhomologous end joining reconnects ends without requiring a long matching template and can preserve compatible ends. Microhomology-associated joining uses short matching sequences after end processing. Theta-mediated end joining names a POLQ-mediated mechanism; finding short matches alone does not identify that enzyme. These routes overlap in outcomes without becoming interchangeable definitions.\n\nKu binds broken ends, and ligase IV with supporting factors can help align and seal them; difficult ends can require processing. Resection exposes single-stranded regions for alternative joining, where short matches can align and intervening sequence can be lost. Purified-factor experiments, defined chromosome-break reporters and controlled cellular studies test particular substrates and factor dependencies, not a universal menu for every break.\n\nA fictional top-strand sequence CA-GAC-TT|AA-GAC-GT has 14 base pairs before joining. A selected short-match product CA-GAC-GT retains seven, losing the four-base TTAA interval and one three-base GAC repeat. For a selected alignment of GAC with its complementary CTG sequence, trimming the unmatched TT flaps leaves seven paired positions and two backbone nicks to seal, without a gap to fill. Other substrates can require synthesis; this arithmetic and schematic geometry are not measured repair frequencies.\n\nSequence a repaired junction and measure a defined repair reporter, then perturb the proposed factor with specificity controls and, where feasible, rescue. Repair fraction, junction distribution and cell survival are distinct outputs. A deletion with microhomology is compatible with a joining route, but does not demonstrate POLQ dependence, selective killing or benefit from a POLQ inhibitor in a patient. Viable-cell and purified-component studies have model-specific input and material costs.",

Glutamine's amide nitrogen feeds purine and pyrimidine synthesis (CAD, PPAT) and hexosamines; glutamate makes glutathione (with cysteine via SLC7A11) and aspartate (KRAS-mutant pancreatic cancer routes glutamine through GOT1 to maintain NADPH). mTORC1 senses glutamine-derived α-KG. Tumour uptake depletes glutamine in the microenvironment, impairing T-cell effector function.

  "In the fictional supply experiment, nuclear SREBP-2 and uptake messages respond to lipid-poor medium; external lipid supply can reduce the response and compensate for synthesis perturbation. Record medium composition, density, timing and viability before assigning dependence. A supply-sensitive state does not establish the response of a person's tumour. Assess precursor and nuclear regulator, responsive transcripts, cellular sterols and uptake separately from labelled synthesis rates. Use controlled supplementation to test the proposed bottleneck; total amount does not specify production or local sensing.",
  "In transgenic mice expressing a truncated SREBP-2 construct, Horton and colleagues observed preferential activation of cholesterol synthesis over fatty-acid synthesis in liver and adipose tissue, contrasting it with earlier SREBP-1a results. They separately measured transcripts and synthesis using labelled water. These are relative effects in a named experimental system, not exclusive duties of each family member or proof that a transcript measurement equals flux. Precursor location and nuclear processing require their own measurements.",
  "Statins inhibit HMG-CoA reductase upstream in the mevalonate pathway, which supplies cholesterol and nonsterol products. In Freed-Pastor and colleagues' breast-cancer 3D cultures, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate partially rescued an invasive phenotype after mutant-p53 depletion or simvastatin treatment. This illustrates why mevalonate rescue alone cannot uniquely attribute an effect to cholesterol. It does not identify every relevant metabolite, establish a universal cancer dependency or show that a statin perturbation reproduces every change in SCAP-SREBP regulation."

IDO1 and TDO deplete tryptophan and produce kynurenine, activating AHR in T cells and Tregs (the IDO1 inhibitor epacadostat failed in ECHO-301 with pembrolizumab); arginase-1 from MDSCs and TAMs depletes arginine, which T cells need for proliferation; glutamine depletion and cysteine competition add to the exhaustion.

    notes: ["Exhaustion is a distinct differentiation programme associated with persistent stimulation, altered function, multiple inhibitory receptors and transcriptional and chromatin changes. Mouse TOX experiments identified a central regulator of this programme. It is neither brief tiredness, every weak assay, anergy nor a DNA sequence change. Deficits can be graded and subsets retain different capacities.","In chronic-infection mice, TCF1-associated progenitor exhausted cells self-renewed and supplied most of the proliferative burst after PD-1 blockade. In mouse tumours, progenitor exhausted cells retained more function and tumour control than terminally exhausted cells and differed in anti-PD-1 response. The melanoma association with longer response duration is human observational evidence, not a universal predictive test or a claim that every terminal cell is inert.","In mouse experiments, PD-L1 blockade re-engaged effector transcription with little remodelling of the exhausted chromatin landscape. Reinvigorated cells could become exhausted again under continued high antigen and did not simply become ordinary durable memory. Laboratory reinvigoration is distinct from universal reversal or patient benefit.","PD-1 can accompany activation as well as exhaustion. TCF1 also occurs in naive and memory contexts. TIM-3/CD39, TOX and residency-associated CD103/CD39 require population and assay context; no single marker assigns state or specificity. Combine compatible response history, protein or RNA programmes, receptor identities and controlled function. TOX may be measured by intracellular staining or RNA; this is not a routine universal pathology classifier.","Paired human basal-cell and squamous-cell skin-cancer biopsies after anti-PD-1 showed expanded clonotypes not previously observed in the same tumour. Clonal replacement and reinvigoration of resident cells are different, potentially overlapping response explanations. Non-detection before therapy is not proof of whole-body absence. Breast-cancer single-cell work identified checkpoint/effector-rich tissue-resident CD8 populations; its early TNBC survival signature was an association, not a general treatment predictor."]

Conversely, intratumoural complement activation is often pro-tumour: C5a-C5aR1 and C3a-C3aR recruit and activate MDSCs and neutrophils, suppress CD8 T cells, and promote angiogenesis; C1q from macrophages supports invasion. Blocking C5aR1 (avdoralimab) with anti-PD-1 was tested; complement is also a mediator of infusion reactions and of CAR-T-associated inflammation. Fc engineering (afucosylation for ADCC versus hexamerisation for CDC) tunes which effector dominates.

    summary: "Natural killer (NK) receptors are encoded in the germ line rather than assembled by the T-cell receptor’s somatic rearrangement process. They integrate complementary activating inputs with inhibitory signals; this is more complex than adding fixed on/off switches. Inhibitory motifs can recruit SHP phosphatases and suppress early activation, while several activating receptors signal through adaptors. Repertoire, receptor variants, prior education, cytokines and the target context matter. Some receptors also occur on T cells, and HLA-related recognition can depend on the bound peptide.\n\nInhibitory KIR2DL1 and KIR2DL2/3 recognize subsets of HLA-C; KIR3DL1 recognizes the Bw4 epitope on class-I molecules. Activating KIRs also exist, with variant-dependent ligands: curated examples include KIR2DS1/HLA-C and KIR3DS1/peptide-free HLA-F. CD94/NKG2A is inhibitory and reads peptide-loaded HLA-E; CD94/NKG2C is activating and bound HLA-E with lower affinity than NKG2A in the recombinant-protein study. CMV seropositivity was associated with NKG2C-rich repertoires in healthy donors. These are defined receptor-ligand findings, not interchangeable switches.",
    analogy: "An NK cell integrates several permission and alarm signals, with responsiveness also shaped by its prior interactions. Removing an inhibitory signal can matter without being enough to trigger killing. Loss of a familiar class-I signal therefore raises a question about NK recognition rather than guaranteeing elimination.",

  "NKG2D is activating and recognizes stress-related MICA, MICB and ULBP ligands; it also occurs on CD8 and gamma-delta T cells. NKp30, NKp44 and NKp46 are natural cytotoxicity receptors with adaptor-dependent signalling. Activating DNAM-1/CD226 recognizes CD155 and CD112; inhibitory TIGIT recognizes this ligand system as well. CD16 recognizes antibody Fc and can supply antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Fc design changes that interaction. Receptor identity is different from the cancer antigen bound by an antibody, and Long’s review describes conditions in which CD16 can activate resting NK cells without the complementary inputs required by several other tested receptors. Shared ligand recognition does not by itself measure relative affinity, competitive occupancy or which receptor input dominates in a particular cell and target pair.",
  "Education tunes responsiveness. NK cells with matched self-HLA inhibitory interactions can be more responsive to later activating stimuli, while unmatched cells can be hyporesponsive. In Juelke’s human-cell experiments, cytokine-stimulated hyporesponsive cells acquired competence when they acquired KIR in the presence of its cognate MHC. This is not a fixed panel present identically on every NK cell. Removing one inhibitory HLA interaction is not necessarily removal of all restraints or a sufficient activation signal.",
  "Groh found reduced NKG2D on tumour-infiltrating and matched blood T cells in people with cancer, associated with circulating soluble tumour-derived MICA and impaired tumour-antigen-specific T-cell responsiveness. That human observation should not silently become a measurement of every NK cell. André’s NKG2A-blockade work supported NK and CD8 activity in laboratory and mouse systems and reported an early combination-trial signal. Those observations did not establish comparative clinical efficacy.",
  "INTERLINK-1 tested monalizumab plus cetuximab against placebo plus cetuximab after checkpoint therapy and platinum progression in recurrent/metastatic head-and-neck cancer. The HPV-unrelated primary analysis set contained 216 participants, randomized 2:1. Median overall survival was 8.8 versus 8.6 months, HR 1.00 (95% CI 0.66 to 1.54); the trial met its prespecified futility criterion. This negative comparison does not support a general claim of clinical success for NKG2A blockade.",
  "Flow cytometry measures receptor proteins on defined viable populations; KIR/HLA genotyping identifies possible pairs; tissue protein or RNA tests ask about ligands; a controlled NK-target assay measures killing. A fictional target lacking all measured HLA restraints but lacking measured activating ligands need not be killed. An antibody engaging CD16 supplies a further hypothesis to test. Receptor expression, degranulation, target death, tumour entry and patient benefit remain separate measurements.",
  "An activating-KIR label does not imply that the gene is present in every person or that its ligand is interchangeable with another receptor’s. IPD-KIR describes haplotypes with different numbers and combinations of KIR genes, including activating genes. Genotyping establishes gene presence rather than protein expression on every NK cell. Long’s 2013 review noted unidentified ligands for some activation receptors; the named receptor-variant assignments above are individual examples, not a complete ligand map."

Fibroblasts often cut the trail first. The enzyme blockers of the 1990s failed; today's targets are the grip (integrins, FAK) and the trail-makers.",
    summary: "Invasion cycles through protrusion (RAC1-driven lamellipodia, actin-rich invadopodia with cortactin and TKS5), adhesion (integrins α5β1, αvβ3, αvβ6 to fibronectin/collagen, signalling via FAK-SRC and ILK), matrix degradation (membrane-anchored MT1-MMP/MMP14 activating MMP2, secreted MMP9, uPA-uPAR-plasmin, cathepsins), and RHO-ROCK-myosin contraction. Modes: mesenchymal (protease-dependent, elongated), amoeboid (protease-independent squeezing through pores, RHO/ROCK-high), and collective invasion led by leader cells (keratin-14+ in breast cancer) or by CAFs that generate tracks and pull via N-cadherin/E-cadherin heterotypic junctions. Perineural and lymphovascular invasion are histological markers of the process; stiff, aligned collagen (TACS-3) promotes it. Broad-spectrum MMP inhibitors (marimastat, prinomastat) failed in phase 3 with musculoskeletal toxicity and because MMPs also produce anti-angiogenic fragments. Current approaches: FAK inhibitors (defactinib, approved with avutometinib in KRAS-mutant low-grade serous ovarian cancer; also reduce stromal density), integrin antagonists (cilengitide failed in GBM), uPAR-targeted CAR-T for senescent cells, and RHO/ROCK inhibitors.",

    summary: "First described by Sharma et al. (2010) in EGFR-mutant lung cancer cells surviving erlotinib, persisters are a reversible, largely non-genetic state resembling bacterial persistence and embryonic diapause: slow-cycling, with chromatin changes (KDM5A-dependent histone demethylation, H3K27me3 gain), activation of IGF1R, YAP/TAZ, NF-κB, Notch and AXL, autophagy, altered metabolism (reliance on fatty acid oxidation, low glutathione), reduced apoptotic priming, upregulated ABC transporters, and a mesenchymal-like, ALDH-high phenotype. Their lipid metabolism creates dependence on GPX4, so ferroptosis inducers kill them selectively in models. During persistence, downregulated repair and APOBEC activity increase mutagenesis, so genuine resistance mutations (EGFR T790M, C797S) often arise from persisters ('bet hedging' then 'commitment'). MRD detected by ctDNA after targeted therapy or in adjuvant settings partly reflects this population; senescence-like persisters share SASP features. Strategies: drug holidays and intermittent dosing to prevent commitment, GPX4/ferroptosis inducers, BCL-XL/MCL-1 inhibitors to remove the survival buffer, KDM5 or EZH2 inhibitors to block the epigenetic switch, and upfront combinations that hit the persister programme (osimertinib + chemotherapy in FLAURA2, + amivantamab in MARIPOSA).",

The unsuccessful clinical development of several P-glycoprotein inhibitors does not identify one universal reason for failure, and a resistant cell model does not itself select a treatment for a person.",

  "Which pump handles which drug, and on what evidence. ABCG2 confers resistance to SN-38 and topotecan: in HEK-293 cells made to express wild-type or mutant ABCG2, cytotoxicity assays showed high resistance to mitoxantrone, SN-38 and topotecan and no appreciable resistance to etoposide or taxol (Robey et al. 2003), while in SN-38-resistant breast and gastric cell lines ABCG2 inhibitors restored SN-38 toxicity (Chang et al. 2016, SN-38 only). For P-gp, a brentuximab vedotin-resistant Hodgkin lymphoma line showed MMAE resistance and MDR1 upregulation, and 1 of 10 Hodgkin lymphoma patient samples expressed MDR1 (Chen et al.). Robey and colleagues' 2018 review describes ABCC1-mediated resistance to doxorubicin, etoposide and vincristine, transport of glutathione and glucuronide conjugates, and protective transporters at the brain and placental barriers. Zeng and colleagues' 2001 transport study also demonstrated MRP1 transport of methotrexate and folates, with polyglutamylation strongly limiting methotrexate transport. These are cell-line and overexpression models, not measurements of a tumour, and these laboratory findings do not validate a pump assay for selecting clinical therapy; Robey et al. 2018 describe efforts to make MDR1 a therapeutic target as unsuccessful so far. Normal-tissue protection also has experimental support: Zhou and colleagues found greater mitoxantrone sensitivity in Bcrp1-deficient mouse haematopoietic cells than in wild-type cells, supporting a protective role in that model. Robey's review also describes gastrointestinal transport affecting oral availability. These normal-tissue roles should not be confused with a cancer-specific mechanism.",
  "Antibody-drug conjugates meet pumps after delivery. Direct transport by an efflux pump concerns a released payload that is its substrate, rather than export of the intact antibody-drug conjugate during endocytosis; A neighbouring cell could likewise export a payload that entered it, but a reduced bystander effect is a mechanistic hypothesis here, not a demonstrated clinical result. The absence of this efflux mechanism does not prove that delivery, release or target action succeeded; other barriers can remain. In breast cancer cells made resistant to trastuzumab deruxtecan or sacituzumab govitecan, resistance was mainly payload-specific, notably more efflux-transporter activity rather than loss of antigen, and ADCs with microtubule-inhibitor payloads restored activity in cells and animals (Rampa et al.); exatecan conjugates with a traceless self-immolative linker moiety overcame resistance of DXd and SN-38 conjugates in multidrug-resistance-positive models (Weng et al.). A study could compare intact ADC and free payload on the same cells, with and without a pump inhibitor, to ask which delivery step is affected. That comparison would still need controls for the inhibitor's other effects."

    tldr: "Under pressure from a drug that blocks its identity (the androgen receptor in prostate cancer, EGFR in lung cancer), a tumour can change what kind of cell it is, becoming a small-cell neuroendocrine cancer that no longer needs the blocked signal. It is the ultimate escape: not a new mutation in the engine, but a new engine.",
    summary: "Lineage plasticity requires loss of the gatekeepers TP53 and RB1 (Ku et al., Mu et al. 2017), which unlocks SOX2, EZH2-mediated repression of lineage genes, and reactivation of neural programmes (ASCL1, NEUROD1, INSM1, BRN2), producing AR-indifferent neuroendocrine prostate cancer in 15-20% of castration-resistant cases after potent AR inhibitors, and small-cell transformation in ~5-15% of EGFR-mutant NSCLC on osimertinib (also after ALK inhibitors and in immunotherapy-treated adenocarcinoma). Related transitions: squamous transdifferentiation of adenocarcinoma, sarcomatoid dedifferentiation in RCC and mesothelioma, MITF-low neural-crest states in melanoma under BRAF inhibitors, and blast/Richter transformation in lymphoid cancers. The new state expresses DLL3, SEZ6, B7-H3, CEACAM5 and loses PSMA or EGFR dependence, is transiently sensitive to platinum-etoposide, and is detected by biopsy at progression (recommended when PSA is low relative to disease burden or ctDNA shows TP53/RB1 loss) and by DLL3 PET. Therapeutics: DLL3 engagers (tarlatamab), EZH2 inhibitors (mevrometostat + enzalutamide, tazemetostat) to block or reverse the switch, Aurora A inhibitors for MYCN/ASCL1 states, and B7-H3 or SEZ6 ADCs.",
    analogy: "A shop that sells hats is fined every time it sells a hat (AR blockade). One day it reopens as a bakery. The fine no longer applies, the old inspectors (PSA, PSMA scans) see nothing, and only a new set of tools works against the new business.",
