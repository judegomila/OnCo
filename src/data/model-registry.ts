 * Model and dataset registry: comparable structured fields for the foundation models (technologies tagged
 * `foundation-model` or `risk-model`) and the training datasets (collections) already in the corpus.
 *
 * Keyed by the existing entity id, so every row links to a page and nothing here duplicates a name or summary.
 * Figures (parameters, training-set size) are those the developers reported in the paper or model card linked from
 * the entity; where a figure is not public the field is left out rather than estimated. `weights` describes how the
 * model can be obtained today: open (download without gating), gated (download after accepting terms or a request
 * form), request (academic access by application), api (hosted access only), proprietary (not available).
 * Licence strings are copied from the model card or repository; blank means we have not verified one.
 *
 * Rendered at /models/ as a faceted table.
