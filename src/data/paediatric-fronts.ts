Randomisation was stopped early for efficacy and all subsequent patients received rituximab. Rituximab roughly doubled the rate of hypogammaglobulinaemia and increased infections, so immune monitoring is part of follow-up.

Its papers quantified the late-effects burden: by age 50 most survivors have a severe or life-threatening chronic condition, driven by anthracyclines, chest radiotherapy, cranial radiotherapy and alkylators. Armstrong et al. (NEJM 2016) analysed 34,033 survivors: of 3,958 deaths, 1,618 (41%) were health-related (746 subsequent neoplasms, 241 cardiac, 137 pulmonary). Fifteen-year all-cause mortality fell from 12.4% for diagnoses in the early 1970s to 6.0% in the 1990s, and health-related mortality from 3.5% to 2.1%, attributable to reduced cranial radiotherapy in ALL, reduced abdominal radiotherapy in Wilms tumour and less anthracycline exposure. CCSS data underpin the COG Long-Term Follow-Up Guidelines, the dexrazoxane and cardiac-screening evidence, and the case for treatment de-escalation in trials such as ACNS0331 and AREN0533.

The FDA Oncology Center of Excellence maintains the relevant and non-relevant molecular target lists (updated after Pediatric Oncology Subcommittee of ODAC meetings) and issues written requests and waivers.
