/**
 * Red-flag "when to call" cards, keyed by drug id and/or by a regular expression over `drug.modality`.
 *
 * Each flag names the symptom, the threshold as the source phrases it, the action tier and the source.
 * Sources are boxed warnings and Warnings and Precautions in the US prescribing information (DailyMed
 * or accessdata.fda.gov), the ASCO immune-related adverse events guideline, the ASTCT consensus grading
 * for CRS and ICANS, and NICE CG151 for the fever rule. Nothing here is a number without a source.
 *
 * `general` applies to everyone on systemic anticancer treatment and is always shown first.
 *
 * Verifying a source URL before you cite it. A status code is not proof either way. A CMS that has
 * lost a file answers a `.pdf` request with an HTML "page not found" page, sometimes with a 200 and
 * sometimes with a 404 (the retired UKONS triage URL, `ukons.org/site/assets/files/1134/...`, serves
 * a 43 KB HTML page with a 404). So check the content type and the size, not the status:
 *     curl -sL -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code} %{content_type} %{size_download}\n' <url>
 * A PDF citation must report `application/pdf` and a plausible size; anything answering `text/html`
 * is a soft 404 however healthy the status looks. `scripts/check-links.ts` applies the same rule to
 * every URL here (exported as `redFlagSourceUrls`): a `.pdf` URL that answers with HTML is recorded
 * as broken, so the weekly link check catches the next move on its own.
