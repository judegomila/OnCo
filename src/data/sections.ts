    summary: "Anatomic imaging (CT, MRI, ultrasound) shows shape and size. Functional and molecular imaging (PET, SPECT) shows biology: glucose uptake, receptor expression, immune cell presence. The frontier is target-specific PET that predicts whether a targeted drug will work, and imaging that reads out treatment response within days rather than months.",

Technologies filed here include low-dose CT lung screening, colorectal cancer screening, HPV DNA testing and self-sampling, mammography and tomosynthesis, whole-body MRI, MCED and DNA methylation profiling.

These agents remain curative in several cancers and now serve as the payloads inside antibody-drug conjugates, so progress lies in dosing, sequencing, biomarker-guided de-escalation and toxicity mitigation rather than in new cytotoxics alone. Technologies that point here include cytotoxic chemotherapy, platinum agents, topoisomerase-I inhibitors, autologous and tandem stem cell transplant, PET-adapted therapy, HIPEC and PIPAC, TACE, chronotherapy and metabolic therapy.

It covers checkpoint inhibitors against PD-1, PD-L1, CTLA-4 and LAG-3, bispecific T-cell engagers, cancer vaccines including personalised mRNA neoantigen vaccines, oncolytic viruses, cytokines and innate-immune agonists.
