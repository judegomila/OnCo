// ======================= CANCER PATCH =======================
const spike: Spike = {

    asOf,
    summary: "Cervical cancer is almost entirely caused by persistent infection with high-risk human papillomavirus, which makes it the one common cancer that could be eliminated: HPV vaccination prevents about 90% of cases, HPV screening finds the precancers that remain, and a minute of thermal ablation or a loop excision cures them. Around 660,000 women are diagnosed and 350,000 die each year, nine in ten of them in low- and middle-income countries where vaccination and screening have not reached. In Sweden, Scotland, and Australia, cohorts vaccinated at 12-13 show near-zero invasive cancer, and Australia expects to pass the WHO elimination threshold (4 per 100,000) around 2035.\n\nFor women who develop cancer, treatment depends on stage. Early disease is treated with open radical hysterectomy (minimally invasive surgery proved worse in the LACC trial) or, for the smallest tumours, fertility-sparing surgery, with sentinel node mapping under evaluation. Locally advanced disease is cured in roughly two-thirds by cisplatin chemoradiation with brachytherapy, and two 2023-24 trials improved on that standard for the first time since 1999: six weeks of induction carboplatin-paclitaxel (INTERLACE, 5-year OS 80% vs 72%) and pembrolizumab with chemoradiation (KEYNOTE-A18, 36-month OS 82.6% vs 74.8%). Metastatic or recurrent disease, once treated with chemotherapy alone, now has first-line chemotherapy plus a checkpoint inhibitor with or without bevacizumab (KEYNOTE-826, BEATcc, COMPASSION-16 in China), the tissue-factor ADC tisotumab vedotin in second line (innovaTV 301), and HER2-directed therapy for the minority with HER2-positive tumours.\n\nWhat comes next is mostly delivery rather than discovery: single-dose HPV vaccination and self-sampled HPV testing to reach the 90-70-90 targets, screen-and-treat with portable ablation devices, AI-read colposcopy, and cheaper immunotherapy access. On the treatment side, HPV ctDNA to guide who needs maintenance therapy, TROP2 ADCs (sacituzumab tirumotecan), TIL therapy, and therapeutic HPV vaccines are in trials. The enduring problem is that the tools already exist and the women who die do not have them.",
    burden: "Cervical cancer is almost entirely preventable by HPV vaccination and screening, and cohorts vaccinated at 12-13 show near-zero invasive cancer. It still causes ~660,000 cases and ~350,000 deaths per year, nine in ten in low- and middle-income countries; it is the fourth most common cancer in women worldwide and the leading cause of cancer death among women in many sub-Saharan African countries.",
