    summary: "In biliary tract cancer driven by FGFR2 fusions, resistance to pemigatinib and futibatinib arises through polyclonal FGFR2 kinase-domain mutations that appear in cell-free DNA weeks before scans show progression. The idea is to monitor plasma ctDNA serially and switch pre-emptively to a next-generation inhibitor such as tinengotinib or lirafugratinib that still covers the emerging mutation. The rationale is that these resistance mutations are drug-specific and predictable, and molecular progression precedes clinical progression. The proposed test is a randomised phase 2 of ctDNA-triggered versus imaging-triggered switching with time to chemotherapy as the endpoint, at an early clinical stage, bearing on the liquid biopsy and kinase inhibitor technologies and the FGFR2 target.",

    tldr: "Cholangiocarcinoma is cancer of the bile ducts or gallbladder. It is rare and often found late, but it turned out to carry more targetable mutations than almost any other gastrointestinal cancer, and immunotherapy now adds to chemotherapy from the first treatment.",
    summary: "Biliary tract cancers comprise intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA, rising in incidence), perihilar and distal extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and gallbladder cancer. They share late presentation (jaundice, weight loss) and dependence on surgical resection as the only cure, achievable in a minority, which keeps five-year survival under 20%. Risk factors differ by region: liver flukes and hepatolithiasis in East Asia, primary sclerosing cholangitis in the West, gallstones and chronic inflammation for gallbladder cancer. Biliary drainage is usually a prerequisite for any treatment.\n\nThe systemic landscape was gemcitabine-cisplatin alone from ABC-02 (2010) until TOPAZ-1 (durvalumab, 2022) and KEYNOTE-966 (pembrolizumab, 2023) added PD-(L)1 blockade with a modest median benefit but a doubling of two-year survival. Adjuvant capecitabine (BILCAP) is standard after resection. What sets biliary cancer apart is its genomic actionability: roughly 40% of intrahepatic tumours carry FGFR2 fusions (pemigatinib, futibatinib), IDH1 mutations (ivosidenib), HER2 amplification or overexpression (zanidatamab, trastuzumab deruxtecan), NRG1 fusions (zenocutuzumab, approved 2026), BRAF V600E, or MSI-high status, so molecular profiling at diagnosis is guideline-mandated.\n\nThe frontier is moving targeted agents into first line (HERIZON-BTC-302 for zanidatamab), overcoming FGFR-inhibitor resistance (tinengotinib in FIRST-308, lirafugratinib), ctDNA-guided sequencing, and finding a biomarker for the immunotherapy long-tail. Liver transplantation for unresectable perihilar tumours (Mayo protocol) and for selected intrahepatic disease is expanding. Open problems include second-line therapy after chemo-immunotherapy, gallbladder cancer's neglect in trials, and early detection in high-risk groups such as primary sclerosing cholangitis.",
