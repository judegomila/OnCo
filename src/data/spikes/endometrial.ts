In the phase 3 KEYNOTE-775 / Study 309 trial the combination improved overall survival compared with chemotherapy both in all comers and in the pMMR population, but dose reductions and discontinuations for toxicity were common.

    summary: "Endometrial cancer is the most common gynaecologic cancer in high-income countries (~420,000 cases a year worldwide) and one of the few cancers whose incidence and mortality are rising, driven by obesity, diabetes, and an ageing population. Most cases are low-grade endometrioid tumours found at stage I because of postmenopausal bleeding, and are cured by hysterectomy; a minority (serous, clear-cell, carcinosarcoma, and other p53-abnormal tumours) behave like high-grade ovarian cancer and account for most deaths. Since 2013, four molecular classes (POLE-mutated, mismatch-repair deficient, p53-abnormal, no specific molecular profile) have replaced histology as the primary prognostic and predictive framework.\n\nThe standard of care for early disease is minimally invasive hysterectomy with sentinel lymph node mapping, and adjuvant therapy scaled to risk: observation or vaginal brachytherapy for low and intermediate risk, pelvic radiotherapy or chemoradiation plus chemotherapy for high risk (PORTEC-3), with molecular class increasingly steering choices and fertility-sparing progestin therapy available for young women with the earliest tumours. Advanced and recurrent disease changed in 2023: three phase 3 trials (RUBY, NRG-GY018, DUO-E) established chemotherapy plus a PD-1/PD-L1 antibody as first-line standard, with dramatic benefit in dMMR tumours and a survival gain in the whole population (RUBY, OS 44.6 vs 28.2 months). Lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab (KEYNOTE-775) remains the second-line option for mismatch-repair-proficient disease, and trastuzumab deruxtecan is approved for HER2 IHC 3+ tumours.\n\nNext: molecular-class-directed adjuvant therapy (RAINBO, PORTEC-4a), folate-receptor and TROP2 ADCs (rinatabart sesutecan with Breakthrough designation, sacituzumab tirumotecan), CDK4/6 plus endocrine therapy for low-grade ER-positive disease, and HER2 ADCs moved earlier in serous cancer. The 2026 failure of selinexor maintenance (XPORT-EC-042) is a caution about subgroup-derived hypotheses. Prevention through weight management and progestin-releasing IUDs, and equitable outcomes for Black women, whose mortality is nearly double, are the population-level problems.",
