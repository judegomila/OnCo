    summary: "Oesophageal cancer is two diseases: squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC, ~85% globally, driven by tobacco, alcohol, hot beverages, and nutritional factors along a belt from Iran through Central Asia to China) and adenocarcinoma (EAC, dominant in the West, arising from Barrett's oesophagus through reflux and obesity). Japan and parts of China screen high-risk populations endoscopically and cure early squamous cancers with endoscopic resection; elsewhere most patients present with dysphagia and locally advanced or metastatic disease. It causes about 510,000 new cases a year (the seventh most common cancer) and, because of late presentation, 445,000 deaths (sixth among cancers); five-year survival is about 20% overall.\n\nLocalised disease is treated with multimodality therapy. CROSS chemoradiation followed by oesophagectomy gives 10-year survival of 38% versus 25% for surgery alone; perioperative FLOT is the alternative for adenocarcinoma (ESOPEC favoured it). Definitive chemoradiation is used for cervical tumours and unfit patients. CheckMate 577 added a year of adjuvant nivolumab for residual disease after chemoradiation (DFS 22.4 vs 11.0 months), and SANO showed that patients with a clinical complete response can be watched rather than operated on with non-inferior survival. Advanced disease is treated with chemotherapy plus PD-1 blockade: pembrolizumab (KEYNOTE-590, both histologies), nivolumab ± ipilimumab (CheckMate 648, squamous), tislelizumab (RATIONALE-306, squamous PD-L1 ≥1%), and camrelizumab or sintilimab in China. HER2-positive adenocarcinoma follows the gastric pathway (trastuzumab, zanidatamab after HERIZON-GEA-01, T-DXd second line). In 2026 the EGFR×HER3 bispecific ADC izalontamab brengitecan became the first agent to improve overall survival in second-line ESCC after immunotherapy (PANKU-Esophagus01).\n\nOpen fronts: whether PD-1 blockade added to definitive chemoradiation raises cure rates (KEYNOTE-975, SKYSCRAPER-07 and Chinese trials), how far organ preservation can be pushed, non-endoscopic screening for Barrett's (BEST4), the absence of targets in squamous disease beyond PD-1 and now EGFR/HER3, and the persistent gap between Asian and Western outcomes that early detection explains.",
    burden: "~510,000 cases per year; ~85% squamous cell carcinoma globally, adenocarcinoma dominant in North America, Western Europe, and Australia. Endoscopic screening, where it exists, cures most early disease. 5-year survival is >80% for endoscopically treated early cancers and ~20% overall; ~445,000 deaths per year.",
