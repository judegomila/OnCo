    summary: "Gastric and gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma is curable when found early: Japan and Korea screen endoscopically and cure most cases. It causes about one million new cases a year, concentrated in East Asia, Eastern Europe, and Latin America, where Helicobacter pylori infection, salt, and smoking drive incidence; elsewhere two-thirds present with advanced disease, which is why it accounts for 660,000 deaths a year and five-year survival outside screened populations is under 30%. Biology splits by the Lauren classification (intestinal vs diffuse) and the TCGA classes (EBV-positive, MSI, genomically stable, chromosomally unstable), and clinically by three actionable biomarkers: HER2 (~15-20%), PD-L1 (CPS ≥5 in ~60%), and Claudin 18.2 (~38% at the approval threshold), with FGFR2b, MSI, and EBV as further strata.\n\nLocalised disease is treated with gastrectomy and D2 lymphadenectomy plus perioperative chemotherapy: FLOT in the West, adjuvant S-1 or CAPOX in Asia. MATTERHORN (2025) added durvalumab to FLOT, the first perioperative immunotherapy with an overall survival benefit (3-year OS 68.6%). Advanced disease is stratified at diagnosis: HER2-positive tumours get trastuzumab + chemotherapy + pembrolizumab (KEYNOTE-811) or, after HERIZON-GEA-01, zanidatamab + chemotherapy ± tislelizumab; HER2-negative, PD-L1 CPS ≥5 tumours get nivolumab or pembrolizumab with chemotherapy (CheckMate 649 5-year OS 16% vs 6%); CLDN18.2-positive tumours get zolbetuximab + chemotherapy (SPOTLIGHT/GLOW). Second line: T-DXd for HER2-positive disease (DESTINY-Gastric04, OS 14.7 vs 11.4 months), ramucirumab + paclitaxel otherwise, and from 2026 the CLDN18.2 ADC sonesitatug vedotin (CLARITY-Gastric 01). Third line: trifluridine/tipiracil.\n\nThe frontier is Claudin 18.2 (ADCs, CAR-T satri-cel approved in China, bispecifics), biomarker overlap and combination quadruplets, peritoneal-directed therapy for the commonest site of relapse, FGFR2b after the mixed FORTITUDE-101 result, and ctDNA-guided perioperative strategies.
