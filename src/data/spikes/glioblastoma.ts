    summary: "Gliomas are classified by the WHO 2021 system on molecular grounds: IDH-wild-type glioblastoma (grade 4, ~50% of gliomas, median age 65, median survival ~15 months with maximal therapy), IDH-mutant astrocytoma (grades 2-4) and 1p/19q-codeleted oligodendroglioma (better prognosis, decades of survival possible), and paediatric-type tumours including H3 K27M-mutant diffuse midline glioma (median survival ~11 months) and BRAF-altered low-grade glioma (the commonest childhood brain tumour, rarely life-threatening but chronically disabling). The two shared barriers are the blood-brain barrier, which excludes most drugs, and diffuse infiltration, which makes complete resection impossible.\n\nGlioblastoma treatment has been static since 2005: maximal safe resection (improved by 5-ALA fluorescence, intraoperative MRI, and awake mapping), radiotherapy with concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide (Stupp), and tumour treating fields (EF-14). MGMT promoter methylation predicts temozolomide benefit; unmethylated patients derive little. Every major systemic trial since has failed: bevacizumab (PFS only), rindopepimut (ACT IV), nivolumab (CheckMate 143, 498, 548), depatuxizumab mafodotin (INTELLANCE-1), and many more. At recurrence, lomustine, re-resection, re-irradiation, LITT, and bevacizumab for oedema are the options, with median survival under a year. DCVax-L's externally controlled phase 3 remains contested.\n\nProgress has come at the edges. Vorasidenib (INDIGO, approved 2024) is the first targeted therapy for grade 2 IDH-mutant glioma, delaying radiation and chemotherapy by years. Tovorafenib (2024) is the first targeted therapy for BRAF-altered paediatric low-grade glioma. Dordaviprone (August 2025) is the first drug approved for H3 K27M diffuse midline glioma. Methylation-based classification and intraoperative nanopore sequencing have transformed diagnosis. For glioblastoma itself the most promising directions are locoregional CAR-T (IL13Rα2, GD2, multi-target), focused-ultrasound and LITT-based barrier opening to deliver ADCs, radioconjugates, and chemotherapy, neoadjuvant immunotherapy with window designs, personalised neoantigen vaccines (NeoVax), and combinations built on the unmethylated-MGMT population where temozolomide adds nothing.",
