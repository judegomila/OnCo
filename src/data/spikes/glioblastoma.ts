    tldr: "How much of a brain tumour the surgeon removes, measured on an MRI scan soon after the operation. In glioblastoma, the less tumour left behind, the longer patients tend to live, provided the surgery does not cause new disability.",
    summary: "Extent of resection is measured volumetrically on early postoperative MRI as the share of tumour removed or, better, as residual volume. In glioblastoma the evidence is observational but consistent: a survival advantage appears from about 78% resection of contrast-enhancing tumour and increases stepwise up to 95-100% (Sanai 2011, n=500); a meta-analysis of 37 studies and 41,117 patients found lower 1-year mortality with gross total than subtotal resection (RR 0.62) and with any resection than biopsy (RR 0.77), on moderate-to-low quality evidence (Brown 2016). The only randomised evidence is indirect: 5-ALA fluorescence raised complete resection of enhancing tumour from 36% to 65% and 6-month progression-free survival from 21.1% to 41.0% (Stummer 2006). Removing non-enhancing tumour as well is associated with longer survival: younger patients with IDH-wild-type glioblastoma whose enhancing and non-enhancing tumour were both aggressively resected had survival similar to patients with IDH-mutant tumours (median OS 37.3 months for that group), against 16.5 months when non-enhancing tumour was left (Molinaro 2020, n=761). The RANO resect group turned this into four prognostic classes for trials and reporting: class 1 supramaximal resection (no enhancing tumour and 5 cm3 or less of non-enhancing tumour left), class 2 maximal, class 3 submaximal resection of enhancing tumour, and class 4 biopsy (Karschnia 2023, n=1,008). Selection bias is inherent, since resectable tumours sit in safer locations in fitter patients, and no trial has randomised patients to more versus less resection; resection is pursued only as far as function allows, which is what awake mapping, intraoperative MRI and fluorescence guidance are for.",

    summary: "Gliomas are classified by the WHO 2021 system on molecular grounds: IDH-wild-type glioblastoma (grade 4, ~50% of gliomas, median age 65, median survival ~15 months with maximal therapy), IDH-mutant astrocytoma (grades 2-4) and 1p/19q-codeleted oligodendroglioma (better prognosis, decades of survival possible), and paediatric-type tumours including H3 K27M-mutant diffuse midline glioma (median survival ~11 months) and BRAF-altered low-grade glioma (the commonest childhood brain tumour, rarely life-threatening but chronically disabling). The two shared barriers are the blood-brain barrier, which excludes most drugs, and diffuse infiltration, which makes complete resection impossible.\n\nGlioblastoma treatment has been static since 2005: maximal safe resection (improved by 5-ALA fluorescence, intraoperative MRI, and awake mapping; the extent of resection is itself prognostic and is now graded by the RANO resect classes), radiotherapy with concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide (Stupp), and tumour treating fields (EF-14). MGMT promoter methylation predicts temozolomide benefit; unmethylated tumours gain less, though not nothing, and how much remains debated (in the elderly trials NOA-08 and Nordic, unmethylated tumours did better with radiotherapy than with temozolomide alone). Every major systemic trial since has failed: bevacizumab (PFS only), rindopepimut (ACT IV), nivolumab (CheckMate 143, 498, 548), depatuxizumab mafodotin (INTELLANCE-1), and many more. At recurrence, lomustine, re-resection, re-irradiation, LITT, and bevacizumab for oedema are the options, with median survival under a year. DCVax-L's externally controlled phase 3 remains contested.\n\nProgress has come at the edges. Vorasidenib (INDIGO, approved 2024) is the first targeted therapy for grade 2 IDH-mutant glioma, delaying radiation and chemotherapy by years. Dabrafenib with trametinib (2023) was the first targeted therapy approved for BRAF V600E paediatric low-grade glioma; tovorafenib (2024) followed for relapsed or refractory BRAF-altered tumours, including BRAF fusions. Dordaviprone (August 2025) is the first drug approved for H3 K27M diffuse midline glioma. Methylation-based classification and intraoperative nanopore sequencing have transformed diagnosis. For glioblastoma itself the most promising directions are locoregional CAR-T (IL13Rα2, GD2, multi-target), focused-ultrasound and LITT-based barrier opening to deliver ADCs, radioconjugates, and chemotherapy, neoadjuvant immunotherapy with window designs, personalised neoantigen vaccines (NeoVax), and combinations built on the unmethylated-MGMT population where temozolomide adds nothing.",
