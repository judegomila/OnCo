    summary: "Ficerafusp alfa (Bicara Therapeutics) is a bifunctional antibody: an anti-EGFR IgG1 with the extracellular domain of TGF-beta receptor II fused to its heavy chain, so it blocks EGFR on tumour cells and neutralises TGF-beta locally, removing an immune-suppressing signal that keeps HPV-negative head and neck tumours cold. It is given at 1500 mg every 2 weeks with pembrolizumab in first-line HPV-negative head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. A phase 1/1b study with pembrolizumab showed durable responses at two years (JCO 2025). The FORTIFI-HN01 phase 2/3 trial fixed the dose at 1500 mg, excludes HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer, and expects an interim analysis in mid-2027. Whether trapping TGF-beta adds meaningfully to EGFR and PD-1 blockade in a randomised setting is the open question. For a newcomer, it is an EGFR antibody fused to a TGF-beta sponge.",

    summary: "Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma arises from the lining of the mouth, throat (oropharynx, hypopharynx), voice box, and nose, and includes the distinct Epstein-Barr-virus-driven nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Two epidemics coexist: tobacco- and alcohol-related cancers, declining in rich countries but common globally, and HPV-driven oropharyngeal cancer, rising among younger non-smokers and now the most common HPV cancer in the US. HPV-positive disease is far more curable (3-year survival >80%) and has its own staging system.\n\nCurative treatment is surgery (increasingly transoral robotic surgery) and/or cisplatin-based chemoradiation with IMRT; both leave lasting effects on speech, swallowing, and salivation, which is why de-escalation for HPV-positive disease has been pursued so hard, and why its repeated failure (RTOG 1016, De-ESCALaTE, NRG-HN005) matters. Immunotherapy transformed recurrent and metastatic disease: nivolumab (CheckMate 141) and then pembrolizumab first line (KEYNOTE-048) replaced the cetuximab-chemotherapy EXTREME regimen, and in June 2025 KEYNOTE-689 delivered the first perioperative approval, doubling event-free survival by giving pembrolizumab before and after surgery. Immunotherapy given concurrently with chemoradiation, by contrast, has failed repeatedly. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma gained its first US approval with toripalimab plus chemotherapy in 2023.\n\nWhat is coming: EGFR-directed bispecifics with pembrolizumab (petosemtamab, ficerafusp alfa) posting response rates two to three times those of pembrolizumab alone in early trials, now in phase 3; photoimmunotherapy (approved in Japan) in global phase 3; ctHPV-DNA to guide response-adapted de-escalation; and B7-H3 and EGFR×HER3 ADCs.
