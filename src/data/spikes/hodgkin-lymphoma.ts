In the phase 1 study of brentuximab plus ABVD, pulmonary toxicity was frequent and some patients died, so the phase 3 ECHELON-1 trial dropped bleomycin and used brentuximab with AVD. The RATHL trial showed that bleomycin can be omitted after a negative interim PET scan, so PET-adapted therapy now lets most patients with Hodgkin lymphoma avoid it; the rationale is additive pneumotoxicity and the small contribution bleomycin makes once PET2 is negative. Toxicity also rises with age, renal impairment, G-CSF and oxygen exposure, and the record is also linked from the record on germ cell tumours of childhood and adolescence.",

    summary: "Classical Hodgkin lymphoma is already cured in most young people, so the aim of this idea is to cure early-stage disease without the chemotherapy and radiotherapy that cause heart disease and second cancers decades later. Brentuximab vedotin plus nivolumab hits the Reed-Sternberg cell through CD30 and its immune shield through PD-1 and PD-L1, and the doublet has produced high complete response rates in relapsed disease and as frontline induction in older patients in the SGN35-015 cohort. The hypothesis is that PET- or ctDNA-adapted brentuximab-nivolumab with minimal or no chemotherapy achieves high progression-free survival in stage I to II disease with fewer late effects than ABVD-based therapy.

    summary: "Classical Hodgkin lymphoma is a B-cell cancer in which rare, giant Reed-Sternberg cells (about 1% of the mass) recruit an inflammatory microenvironment and hide behind amplified PD-L1. It peaks in young adults and again after 55, is staged with PET-CT and the Lugano system, and is cured in more than 85% of patients overall and in over 90% of early-stage disease. Because most patients are young and will live for decades, the field's defining problem is not cure but the cost of cure: anthracycline heart disease, bleomycin lung injury, infertility, and second cancers from alkylators and radiation.\n\nThat is why Hodgkin lymphoma pioneered response-adapted therapy. Interim PET after two cycles (Deauville score) steers de-escalation (drop bleomycin after negative PET2 in RATHL; omit radiotherapy in early stage in HD16/HD17/RAPID at a small PFS cost) or escalation to BEACOPP-type regimens. Two ADC- and immunotherapy-based regimens then replaced ABVD for advanced disease: brentuximab vedotin-AVD (ECHELON-1, overall survival benefit) and, from March 2026, nivolumab-AVD (SWOG S1826, PFS HR 0.45 versus BV-AVD, neuropathy halved, children and adults together). In Europe, GHSG HD21's PET-guided BrECADD matches escalated BEACOPP's ~94% PFS with far less toxicity. Relapse is treated with PD-1 blockade (pembrolizumab beat brentuximab in KEYNOTE-204), brentuximab, salvage chemotherapy and autologous transplant, with brentuximab consolidation for high-risk patients (AETHERA); allogeneic transplant and CD30 CAR-T are options for the few who fail everything.\n\nThe next questions are how far chemotherapy can be removed. AHOD2131 tests brentuximab-nivolumab in early-stage disease across children and adults; ctDNA may replace PET for steering; older patients, who have half the cure rate of young ones, need regimens they can tolerate (nivolumab-AVD, brentuximab-based). Survivorship care for the tens of thousands cured decades ago, and the shift from radiotherapy to systemic de-escalation, remain the field's distinctive concerns.",
    burden: "~83,000 new cases a year worldwide, ~8,500 in the US, with age peaks at 20-30 and over 55. More than 85% are cured, so the research agenda is curing with less toxicity. Five-year survival is ~89% overall in high-income countries; ~23,000 deaths a year worldwide.",
