/**
 * LUNG CANCER: EVIDENCE, HISTORY, ROADMAP AND IDEAS (the evidence file of the September 2026 deep dive).
 *
 * Every paper record carries verbatim metadata from the Europe PMC record read on 2026-09-25 (title, authors, journal,
 * year, DOI, PMID); summaries paraphrase the indexed abstract and findings quote only its figures. Where Europe PMC
 * indexes no abstract (Wynder and Graham 1950, Doll and Hill 1954) the record says so and carries no numbers, and
 * where Europe PMC truncates an abstract at a P value the figure after it is not quoted (FLAURA2). Registry dates in
 * the roadmap's watch list are quoted from ClinicalTrials.gov v2 records read the same day. UK and NHS specifics
 * (Targeted Lung Health Check coverage, NICE positions, molecular testing turnaround, capacity, audit indicators)
 * belong to the UK file of the deep dive and are named here only as placeholders.
 *
 * The cancer this file patches is the `lung-cancer` record (../cancer-parents-wave2.ts), the parent page covering both
 * histologies. If the record is renamed, change LUNG in ./lung-evidence-shared.ts and nothing else. Papers that belong
 * to one histology link `nsclc` or `sclc` as well.
 *
 * Lung cancer is the largest evidence base on the site, so this file prioritises the papers that changed practice over
 * completeness. Papers the corpus already held are linked by id, not repeated: Doll and Hill 1950, the fifty-year
 * British Doctors report, NLST and NELSON, Topalian 2012, KEYNOTE-001, 010, 024, 042, 189 and 407, CheckMate 017, 057,
 * 227 and 816, PACIFIC 2017 and its 2018 update, KEYNOTE-671, FLAURA and its overall survival report, AURA3, ADAURA,
 * PROFILE 1007, crizotinib and entrectinib in ROS1, LIBRETTO-001 and 431, the MET exon 14 landscape paper, dabrafenib
 * and trametinib in BRAF, DESTINY-Lung01 and 02, Beamion Lung 1, CodeBreaK 100, Ostrem's KRAS G12C chemistry,
 * IMpower133, Slotman's prophylactic cranial irradiation trial, the DLL3 expression paper and DeLLphi-304. Trial
 * records belong to the trials file of the deep dive and glossary terms to the terms file; the ids that did not yet
 * exist are listed in PENDING_TRIALS and PENDING_TERMS (./lung-evidence-shared.ts) and named in text only.
