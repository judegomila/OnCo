/**
 * LYMPHOMA, MOLECULAR LAYER. Facts checked 29 and 30 September 2026.
 *
 * The biology under the medicines facet B wrote (src/data/spikes/lymphoma-treatment*.ts): the antigens the
 * antibodies, conjugates, engagers and CAR-T products are aimed at, and what it costs the patient that almost all
 * of them are also carried by healthy cells (`lymphomaAntigens`); the lesions and pathways that make a lymphoma
 * what it is (`lymphomaLesions`); the molecular classifications and how much of a treatment decision each one
 * actually carries today (`lymphomaClassification`); the escape routes from each drug class (`lymphomaResistance`,
 * which also feeds the resistance atlas at /resistance/); and the tests that get run (`lymphomaTests`).
 *
 * Rules this file was written under. Every figure names its cohort and the paper it was read from, and every DOI
 * below was resolved through the Europe PMC REST API and its abstract read before the number was written down. One
 * remembered DOI turned out to belong to a different paper (10.1038/ng.621 is the myeloid loss-of-function EZH2
 * paper, not the lymphoma Tyr641 gain-of-function one, which is 10.1038/ng.518), which is why nothing here is cited
 * from memory. Where a figure could not be verified it is named as a gap rather than estimated.
 *
 * What this file does not create, because other facets of the same round own them: cancer records (facet A),
 * standard-of-care rows (facet B), trial and paper records (facet C). Sources are therefore carried as links on the
 * records this file owns or supplements, not as paper entities.
 *
 * Ids created here: biomarker readouts, one technology, one pathway, and glossary terms prefixed `lymphoma-bio-`.
 * Every target, pathway and technology that already exists is supplemented through SpikeSupplement rather than
 * duplicated; the corpus already holds CD19, CD20, CD79b, CD30, CD22, CD38, CD3, CD47, CCR4, CD52, BTK, BCL-2,
 * BCL6, MYC, EZH2, CREBBP, EP300, TP53, MYD88, CARD11, PLCG2, JAK1/2/3, STAT3, STAT6, RHOA, TET2, DNMT3A and the
 * rest of the genes named below.

    alsoOnHealthyCells: "Every normal B cell from the late pre-B stage to the memory B cell. The Human Protein Atlas reads MS4A1 as tissue enriched in lymphoid tissue (631 nTPM) and lineage enriched in B cells (630 nTPM), which is the strongest B-cell signal of any lymphoma surface target.",
    notCarriedBy: "Haematopoietic stem cells, pro-B cells and plasma cells, which is why the B-cell compartment recovers after treatment stops and why antibody levels from long-lived plasma cells are often preserved at first. Reed-Sternberg cells of classical Hodgkin lymphoma are CD20-negative or only weakly positive, which is why rituximab is not part of classical Hodgkin treatment.",
    whatTheDrugDoes: "CD20 is a tetraspanin that is not internalised when an antibody binds it, so the antibody has to kill from the outside: complement-dependent cytotoxicity, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and phagocytosis. That is why CD20 carries naked antibodies (rituximab, obinutuzumab, ofatumumab) and T-cell engagers (glofitamab, mosunetuzumab, epcoritamab, odronextamab) but no antibody-drug conjugate: there is no route in for a payload.",
    howTumoursLoseIt: "CD20-negative transformation after rituximab is real and under-measured because most relapses are not rebiopsied. In a single-centre series of 124 patients treated with rituximab-containing chemotherapy, 36 relapsed or progressed, 19 were rebiopsied and 5 of those 19 (26.3%) had become CD20 protein-negative; CD20 messenger RNA was lower in the negative cells than in the positive cells from the same patient, so this is transcriptional down-regulation rather than deletion (Hiraga 2009). Trogocytosis, in which macrophages shave antibody-CD20 complexes off the cell surface, lowers the antigen without changing the gene at all.",
    costToPatient: "B-cell aplasia for six to twelve months after the last dose, low immunoglobulin levels that can persist for years, and a measurable rise in bacterial and viral infection. Two consequences are specific and avoidable: hepatitis B reactivation, which is why surface antigen and core antibody are checked before the first dose, and a blunted response to vaccination for several months after treatment.",

    howTumoursLoseIt: "Antigen escape after CAR-T is the best-characterised escape route of any lymphoma surface target. Relapse with loss of the epitope follows 10 to 20% of paediatric responses in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, and the mechanism is a combination: hemizygous deletions across the CD19 locus, de novo frameshift and missense mutations in exon 2, and selection for an alternatively spliced messenger RNA lacking exon 2 whose truncated protein no longer presents the CAR epitope but still partly rescues the cell (Sotillo 2015). CD19 target evasion also occurs in large B-cell lymphoma after axicabtagene ciloleucel (Plaks 2021); OnCo does not hold a share it can stand behind for lymphoma, because the published series are small and the reported figures do not agree.",
    costToPatient: "The same B-cell aplasia and hypogammaglobulinaemia as anti-CD20, but deeper and longer after CAR-T, where it can last years and is managed with immunoglobulin replacement. Because CD19 appears earlier in B-cell development than CD20, recovery is slower.",

Nothing is tested before it is given, because expression is close to universal.",

    alsoOnHealthyCells: "All of them. CD3 is the one target in lymphoma that is not on the tumour at all in B-cell disease: it is the arm the bispecific antibody grips so that the other arm can hold the tumour.",
    notCarriedBy: "B cells, myeloid cells and non-haematopoietic tissue.",
    whatTheDrugDoes: "A CD3-engaging bispecific antibody forces an immunological synapse between a T cell and a tumour cell without needing the T cell to recognise anything, so it bypasses the loss of antigen presentation that defeats a checkpoint inhibitor. Glofitamab, mosunetuzumab, epcoritamab and odronextamab all hold CD20 with the other arm; glofitamab holds two CD20 molecules to one CD3.",

    mechanism: "The B-cell receptor normally signals only when it meets antigen. In activated B-cell-like lymphoma it signals continuously: the receptors cluster in the membrane and diffuse slowly, exactly as they do in an antigen-stimulated normal B cell, and knocking down IgM, Ig-kappa, CD79A, CD79B or BTK kills the cell. The signal runs CD79a/b to SYK to BTK to PLC-gamma-2 to protein kinase C beta to the CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 complex and into NF-kB. Mutations of the ITAM module of CD79B raise surface receptor expression and blunt LYN, the feedback brake (Davis 2010).",

    changesTreatment: "This is the one pathway in lymphoma where the biology picks the drug today. BTK inhibitors are standard in mantle cell lymphoma and Waldenstrom macroglobulinaemia and have activity in primary CNS lymphoma and in the MCD genetic subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; they do little in germinal-centre disease.",

    mechanism: "MYD88 is the adaptor of the toll-like and interleukin-1 receptors. A single substitution at an invariant residue in the hydrophobic core of its TIR domain, L265P, makes it assemble a signalling complex with IRAK1 and IRAK4 without a receptor signal, driving NF-kB and JAK kinase activity. Activated B-cell-like lymphoma cells carrying it die when MYD88, IRAK1 or IRAK4 are knocked down, and the wild-type protein cannot rescue them, so it is a gain-of-function driver rather than a passenger (Ngo 2011).",
    frequency: "L265P in 29% of activated B-cell-like diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, rare or absent in other subtypes and in Burkitt lymphoma, and present in 9% of MALT lymphomas (Ngo 2011). In Waldenstrom macroglobulinaemia it is close to defining: Sanger sequencing found it in 49 of 54 patients, and in 91% of all lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma including the non-IgM form, while it was absent from paired normal tissue and from healthy donor B cells (Treon 2012).",
    changesTreatment: "In Waldenstrom macroglobulinaemia the MYD88 and CXCR4 genotype is now part of the first-line conversation, because BTK inhibitor response differs by it. In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma it marks the MCD subtype, which is the group in which BTK inhibition added to chemoimmunotherapy has shown activity in subgroup analyses, but no licensed regimen is selected on the mutation.",

The sequencing of the breakpoints showed that the translocation is a mistake made by the VDJ recombinase at the pre-B-cell stage: the chromosome 18 segment recombines with the JH segment on chromosome 14, with extraneous N-region nucleotides at the junction and signal-like sequences near the chromosome 18 breakpoint (Tsujimoto 1985). The lesion is therefore not a late event in a lymphoma but the first event, made in the bone marrow years before.",

    mechanism: "MYC was mapped to 8q24, the region translocated to chromosome 2, 14 or 22 in Burkitt lymphoma cells, in 1982 (Dalla-Favera 1982); the partner is always an immunoglobulin locus, so the transcription factor is driven by the enhancer that should be driving antibody production. A double hit is a MYC rearrangement together with a BCL2 rearrangement, a triple hit adds BCL6. The two lesions are complementary rather than additive: MYC drives proliferation and would normally trigger apoptosis, and BCL2 removes that safeguard.",
    frequency: "MYC rearrangement in 8.8% of 442 diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, BCL2 in 13.5% and BCL6 in 28.7% (Horn 2013). Protein overexpression is much commoner than rearrangement: MYC protein above the 40% threshold in 31.8% of the same cohort (Horn 2013), and in a separate 167-patient training cohort MYC protein in 29%, BCL2 protein in 44% and both together in 21%, against MYC translocation in only 11% (Johnson 2012).",
    changesTreatment: "The WHO fifth edition separates high-grade B-cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 rearrangements as its own entity (Alaggio 2022), and in practice a double hit moves most patients off R-CHOP onto a more intensive regimen, although the randomised evidence for doing so is thin. Double expression of the two proteins without rearrangement is prognostic, not a separate entity, and does not by itself change the regimen: in the trial cohort MYC protein predicted worse survival only when BCL2 protein was present too (Johnson 2012).",

A lymphoma that keeps BCL6 on keeps a cell in a state where mutation is permitted and apoptosis is suppressed. The protein is normally switched off by acetylation, which is one reason CREBBP and EP300 loss matters here.",

The lymphoma mutations replace a single tyrosine in the SET domain, Tyr641 in the numbering of the original report and Tyr646 in current usage, and they change what the enzyme can do rather than removing it: the mutant converts the di-methyl mark to the tri-methyl mark efficiently while losing the ability to make the first methylation, so a cell carrying one mutant and one wild-type allele piles up H3K27me3 and holds the germinal-centre programme shut. This is the opposite of the loss-of-function EZH2 mutation found in myeloid disease.",

    mechanism: "CREBBP and EP300 are acetyltransferases. Losing one allele lowers the dose of acetylation, which leaves BCL6 acetylated less often and therefore active more often, and leaves p53 acetylated less often and therefore working less well; the same lesion also turns down the enhancers that would let a germinal-centre cell present antigen to T cells. KMT2D, formerly MLL2, writes H3K4 monomethylation at enhancers and is the single most frequently mutated gene in follicular lymphoma.",

KMT2D mutated in 32% of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and 89% of follicular lymphoma in the discovery series, with MEF2B in 11.4% and 13.4% (Morin 2011); the coding genome of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma carries more than 30 clonally represented alterations per case (Pasqualucci 2011, Nat Genet).",

    mechanism: "TP53 is the commonest route by which a lymphoma stops responding to chemotherapy, because chemotherapy kills largely by provoking a p53-dependent death. In mantle cell lymphoma it travels with blastoid morphology, a high Ki-67 and CDKN2A deletion. In Richter transformation it is one of two lesions that dominate the genetics, and the transformed clone is usually the same clone as the leukaemia rather than a second cancer.",
    frequency: "In 183 younger mantle cell lymphoma patients from the Nordic MCL2 and MCL3 trials, TP53 mutation in 11% and TP53 deletion in 16%, with CDKN2A deletion in 20% and NOTCH1 mutation in 4%; only TP53 mutation kept its prognostic weight in multivariable analysis, with a hazard ratio of 6.2 for overall survival, a median overall survival of 1.8 years against 12.7 years for unmutated cases, and half the mutated group relapsing within a year (Eskelund 2017). In 86 cases of Richter syndrome, TP53 disruption in 47.1% and MYC abnormality in 26.2%; clonally unrelated transformations had both a longer median survival, 62.5 against 14.2 months, and less TP53 disruption, 23.1% against 60.0% (Rossi 2011).",
    changesTreatment: "In mantle cell lymphoma, yes in practice if not yet on any label: a TP53 mutation is the usual reason to abandon intensive cytarabine-based induction and autologous transplant and to go to a BTK inhibitor, a BCL-2 inhibitor or CAR-T instead. In Richter transformation it is the main prognostic variable, and establishing whether the large-cell clone is related to the leukaemic one changes the expected outcome more than any drug does.",

The STAT5B N642H substitution increases the binding affinity of the phosphotyrosine for the mutant histidine, so the phosphorylated protein persists and binds its target sites far more, and the growth advantage it gives can be partly reversed by a JAK1/2 inhibitor in the laboratory (Kucuk 2015). In Hodgkin lymphoma and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma the pathway is switched on from the other end, by amplification of JAK2 inside the 9p24.1 amplicon and by loss of the brakes SOCS1 and PTPN1.",

It is the clearest example in oncology of a tumour genetically buying its way out of T-cell attack. Alongside it, CIITA, the master transactivator of MHC class II, is broken by recurrent fusions, which lowers class II on the tumour cell and, in the same rearrangements, places PD-L1 and PD-L2 under new promoters.",
    frequency: "In 108 newly diagnosed classical Hodgkin lymphomas evaluated by fluorescence in situ hybridisation, 97% had concordant alterations of both loci: polysomy in 5% (5 of 108), copy gain in 56% (61 of 108) and amplification in 36% (39 of 108), and higher-level gain predicted shorter progression-free survival (Roemer 2016). Genomic CIITA breaks in 38% of primary mediastinal B-cell lymphomas and 15% of classical Hodgkin lymphomas across 263 B-cell lymphomas (Steidl 2011).",

PD-1 blockade produced an objective response in 20 of 23 heavily pre-treated Hodgkin patients, 87%, in the first study, in a disease where most had already failed both transplant and brentuximab vedotin (Ansell 2015); in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma outside the mediastinal group, single-agent checkpoint blockade does very little.

Their identity was only settled by picking single cells off a histological section with a micromanipulator and amplifying the immunoglobulin genes: each case gave a single clonal heavy-chain rearrangement, proving that the scattered giant cells are one clone of B-lineage origin even though they have lost almost every B-cell marker (Kuppers 1994). Because the malignant cells are so rare, bulk genomic assays on a Hodgkin biopsy mostly measure the infiltrate, which is why the 9p24.1 work needed laser capture and fluorescence in situ hybridisation rather than sequencing.",

The host genome then acquires the rest of the lesions, and they are not random: the alterations found across 426 cases overlap significantly with the proteins Tax itself binds, and are concentrated in T-cell receptor and NF-kB signalling, T-cell trafficking and immune surveillance, with activating mutations in PLCG1, PRKCB, CARD11, VAV1, IRF4, FYN, CCR4 and CCR7, CTLA4-CD28 and ICOS-CD28 fusions, and intragenic deletions of IKZF2, CARD11 and TP73 (Kataoka 2015).",

In latency I only EBNA1 is made, which is enough to keep the episome but gives the immune system almost nothing to see; this is the Burkitt pattern, where the virus coexists with a MYC translocation. In latency II, EBNA1 with LMP1 and LMP2, LMP1 mimics a permanently engaged CD40 receptor and drives NF-kB; this is the Hodgkin and NK/T-cell pattern. In latency III the full set of nuclear antigens and membrane proteins is expressed and will immortalise a resting B cell outright, which is what happens when T-cell surveillance is removed, as in post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder and HIV-associated lymphoma. The virus was found in the first place by electron microscopy of cells cultured from Burkitt lymphoma, whose geographic distribution matching holoendemic malaria had suggested a viral cause (Young and Rickinson 2004).",

The reference is gene expression profiling, now done with a NanoString-based assay on paraffin tissue; what most laboratories report is the Hans algorithm, three immunohistochemistry stains read in order: CD10, then BCL6, then MUM1.

Survival after immunochemotherapy was favourable in BN2 and EZB and inferior in MCD and N1 (Schmitz 2018). A parallel analysis of 304 primary tumours by consensus clustering found five subsets, including a previously unrecognised low-risk activated B-cell group of extrafollicular or marginal-zone origin, two germinal-centre subsets with different outcomes, and a group independent of cell of origin with biallelic TP53 inactivation and CDKN2A loss (Chapuy 2018).",

  tldr: "To make a good antibody, a B cell has to deliberately damage its own DNA and keep dividing while it does. The germinal centre is where that happens, under strict time limits. Most B-cell lymphomas are cells that went through it and did not come out.",
  summary: "When a B cell meets an antigen it has not seen before, it enters a lymph node follicle and starts a germinal centre. There it does three dangerous things at once. It switches on activation-induced cytidine deaminase, which deliberately mutates the variable region of its own immunoglobulin genes so that a better-binding version can be selected. It cuts and rejoins the constant region to change antibody class. And it divides faster than almost any cell in the body. To survive this, BCL6 holds down the DNA damage response and the differentiation programme, polycomb repressive complex 2 keeps the exit genes methylated shut, and CREBBP and EP300 provide the acetylation that turns the programme back off at the end.\n\nAlmost every lesion in B-cell lymphoma is a failure of one of those safeguards. Translocations of BCL2 and MYC to an immunoglobulin locus are mistakes made by the recombinases that cut these genes on purpose. EZH2 gain-of-function mutations hold the polycomb mark on, so the exit never happens. CREBBP and EP300 loss leaves BCL6 acetylated less and therefore active more. The cell of origin classification of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is a description of where in this reaction the cancer got stuck: germinal-centre-like cells are still inside it, activated B-cell-like cells are at the exit and cannot complete it.\n\nThe reaction is also why these cancers keep their normal lineage's weaknesses.

  tldr: "Receptor-gene patterns can provide evidence of a clonal lymphocyte population. The result must be interpreted with the tissue findings and does not diagnose cancer by itself.",
  summary: "Developing lymphocytes rearrange antigen-receptor genes. Shared rearrangements can support common ancestry, but a detected clonal pattern is not synonymous with malignancy, and a negative assay does not exclude it. Sampling, reactive expansions, multiple alleles, primer coverage and technical artifacts affect interpretation. The number of peaks is not a direct count of clones.\n\nThe European BIOMED-2 collaboration standardised the assay into 107 primers in 18 multiplex tubes covering the immunoglobulin heavy chain in two configurations, the kappa and lambda light chains, the T-cell receptor beta, gamma and delta loci, and the BCL1-IGH and BCL2-IGH translocations, read by heteroduplex analysis or fragment sizing. The EuroClonality-NGS successor sequences the amplicons instead of sizing them, which both improves resolution and produces a patient-specific sequence that can be followed afterwards as a residual disease marker.\n\nThe assay is most often ordered where morphology and immunohistochemistry disagree or where the sample is small: a skin biopsy in suspected cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, a gastric biopsy in suspected MALT lymphoma, a marrow with an ambiguous infiltrate, or a lymph node with an atypical but not clearly malignant population.",
  principle: "Multiplex PCR, or targeted sequencing, across the V, D and J segments of the immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor loci. A clonal population gives amplicons of one length and sequence; a polyclonal population gives a Gaussian spread of lengths. The output is a pattern, not a diagnosis.",
  strengths: [
    "Works on tiny and on fixed samples, including paraffin blocks and skin punch biopsies, where flow cytometry cannot be done",
    "Combined immunoglobulin heavy-chain and kappa tubes detect virtually all clonal B-cell proliferations, even where somatic hypermutation has altered the primer binding sites, and combined T-cell receptor beta and gamma tubes detect virtually all clonal T-cell populations (van Dongen 2003)",

    tldr: "To make a better antibody, a B cell has to deliberately damage its own DNA while dividing fast, with its safety checks switched off. Most B-cell lymphomas are cells that went into that process and never came out of it properly.",
    summary: "A germinal centre forms in a lymph node a few days after a new infection or vaccination. Inside it, a B cell switches on an enzyme called activation-induced cytidine deaminase, which mutates the part of its own DNA that codes for the binding end of the antibody. Cells whose antibody now binds better are kept, the rest die, and the process repeats. The same enzyme cuts and rejoins the gene to change antibody class. This is why a second dose of a vaccine works better than the first.\n\nIt is also the most dangerous thing a healthy cell does. To survive deliberate DNA damage while dividing rapidly, the cell switches off its damage response, through the transcriptional repressor BCL6, and locks the exit shut, through the polycomb complex and its enzyme EZH2. A cell in that state is a cancer waiting for one mistake.\n\nThe mistakes are specific and recognisable. The t(14;18) translocation that puts BCL2 under an antibody gene's control is a recombination error, and the sequence of the breakpoints shows it was made by the normal recombinase at the pre-B-cell stage rather than later (Tsujimoto 1985). MYC lands next to an immunoglobulin locus the same way in Burkitt lymphoma. EZH2 gain-of-function mutations keep the exit locked. CREBBP and EP300 loss, present in about 39% of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and 41% of follicular lymphoma, leaves BCL6 switched on when it should be off (Pasqualucci 2011).\n\nTwo practical consequences follow. First, a lymphoma usually keeps the surface of the normal B cell it came from, which is why CD19, CD20, CD79b and CD22 antibodies work. Second, a t(14;18)-carrying B cell can be found in the blood of healthy people, so the first lesion is not the disease; what makes a lymphoma is what happens afterwards.",

    tldr: "Large B-cell lymphoma is split into two types by which normal B cell it most resembles. The split is real and predicts how the disease behaves, but the test most laboratories run is a cheaper approximation of the one that defined it, and today the result rarely changes which treatment is given.",
    summary: "The split was found by microarray in 2000: some diffuse large B-cell lymphomas express the genes of a germinal-centre B cell and some express the genes of a B cell that has been activated, and the germinal-centre group lived significantly longer (Alizadeh 2000). It was confirmed on 240 patients, where BCL2 translocation and c-REL amplification were found only in the germinal-centre group (Rosenwald 2002).\n\nWhat a report usually shows is not that test. Most laboratories run the Hans algorithm: three immunohistochemistry stains read in a fixed order, CD10, then BCL6, then MUM1. On 152 cases with a microarray comparison, Hans called 42% germinal-centre and 58% non-germinal-centre, with five-year overall survival of 76% against 34% (Hans 2004). The reference method now exists as a NanoString assay usable on paraffin, but it is not run everywhere, and the two methods disagree on a meaningful minority of cases. That is why a careful report says germinal-centre or non-germinal-centre rather than germinal-centre or activated: the immunohistochemistry cannot tell the activated type from the unclassified type.\n\nWhat it changes today is the honest part. Cell of origin is prognostic and it decides eligibility for trials, and every randomised attempt to act on it in first line, by adding ibrutinib, bortezomib or lenalidomide to R-CHOP for the activated group, has so far failed to change survival in the whole population. Nobody is denied R-CHOP because of it, and nobody is given a different regimen because of it outside a trial. A patient told their lymphoma is the activated type should be told what that does and does not mean.",

    tldr: "Sequencing shows that large B-cell lymphoma is at least seven diseases, each defined by which faults occur together. The classification explains a great deal about how the disease behaves and currently changes almost nothing about how it is treated.",
    summary: "Two groups sequenced large series in 2018 and arrived at overlapping answers. Exome and transcriptome sequencing with copy-number analysis across 574 biopsies produced four prominent subtypes named for the lesions that co-occur: MCD for MYD88 L265P with CD79B mutation, BN2 for BCL6 fusions with NOTCH2 mutations, N1 for NOTCH1 mutations, and EZB for EZH2 mutations with BCL2 translocations; survival after immunochemotherapy was better in BN2 and EZB and worse in MCD and N1 (Schmitz 2018). Consensus clustering of 304 primary tumours found five subsets, including a low-risk activated B-cell group of extrafollicular or marginal-zone origin, two germinal-centre subsets with different outcomes, and a group defined by biallelic TP53 inactivation and CDKN2A loss that cuts across cell of origin entirely (Chapuy 2018).\n\nLymphGen is what made these usable on one patient: an algorithm that returns the probability that a lymphoma belongs to one of seven genetic subtypes, and which showed that each subtype shares a pathogenesis with a particular indolent or extranodal lymphoma, so the groups are not statistical artefacts (Wright 2020).\n\nThe limits matter. It needs a sequencing panel that calls mutations, copy number and fusions, not a stain. A substantial share of cases come back unclassified. No regulator licenses anything on a LymphGen call, and no randomised trial has assigned treatment by it. Its real effect so far has been on how trials are designed and how their subgroups are read: the concentration of BTK inhibitor activity in the MCD and N1 subtypes is the clearest example, and it is why the current first-line trials genotype everyone.",

    tldr: "Treatments that find a cancer by one marker on its surface can be defeated if the cancer stops showing that marker. It is one of the main reasons an antibody or CAR-T treatment that worked stops working.",
    summary: "There are at least four ways to lose a surface marker, and they need different answers.\n\nDeletion and mutation. After CD19 CAR-T, relapses can carry hemizygous deletion of the CD19 locus, or frameshift and missense mutations in exon 2, the part the usual CAR binds (Sotillo 2015).\n\nSplicing. The same study found something less obvious: relapsed cells select for an alternatively spliced CD19 messenger RNA that skips exon 2 entirely, producing a shortened protein that the CAR cannot see but which still does enough of the normal job to keep the cell alive. The splicing factor that keeps exon 2 in, SRSF3, was lower in relapsed disease. The gene is still there and a standard sequencing test would call it normal.\n\nTranscriptional down-regulation. After rituximab, the cells that come back can simply make less CD20. In a series where 19 of 36 relapsing patients were rebiopsied, 5 had become CD20-negative by immunohistochemistry, with lower CD20 messenger RNA in the negative cells than in the positive cells from the same patient (Hiraga 2009).\n\nShaving. Macrophages can strip antibody-antigen complexes off the surface of a living cell, a process called trogocytosis, lowering the antigen without any change to the gene.\n\nWhat follows in practice. Rebiopsy at relapse rather than assuming the antigen is still there; where it has gone, change the address rather than the format, to CD19, CD79b, CD22, CD30 or CD3-engaging bispecifics as the disease allows; and, in design terms, build constructs that need two antigens so that losing one is not enough. In B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, epitope loss follows 10 to 20% of paediatric responses to CD19 CAR-T; in large B-cell lymphoma it is documented but OnCo does not hold a share it can stand behind, because the published series are small and disagree.",

],
    tldr: "Some lymphoma treatments recognise lineage antigens shared with healthy cells. Those normal-cell targets can explain particular harms; cytokine-mediated effects and unintended binding are different mechanisms.",
    summary: "Nearly all the surface targets in lymphoma are what the corpus calls lineage antigens: normal proteins on a normal cell type, present on the cancer because the cancer came from that cell type. Only a few, such as CD30, are close to restricted to activated cells in an adult. This has consequences that can be read off the target before the first dose.\n\nCD20 and CD19 are on every normal B cell, so anti-CD20 and anti-CD19 treatments empty the B-cell compartment. What follows is low immunoglobulin, more bacterial and viral infection, a blunted response to vaccination, and, specifically, reactivation of hepatitis B, which is why surface antigen and core antibody are checked before the first dose of rituximab. After CAR-T the aplasia is deeper and longer, sometimes years, and immunoglobulin replacement is part of the plan rather than a rescue.\n\nCD52 is on B cells, T cells, monocytes and dendritic cells, so alemtuzumab produces the most profound lymphopenia of any antibody used in lymphoma, with CD4 counts that can stay low for a year, and with it cytomegalovirus reactivation, Pneumocystis pneumonia and fungal infection.\n\nCCR4 is on regulatory T cells as well as on the tumour, so mogamulizumab removes the cells that hold autoimmunity in check: rash is common, and giving it shortly before an allogeneic transplant has been associated with severe graft-versus-host disease.\n\nCD47 is on red cells, where its job is to tell a macrophage not to eat them, so blocking it causes anaemia by design; the dosing strategy that made the class usable is a low priming dose followed by higher maintenance doses.\n\nCD38 produces a laboratory problem rather than a clinical one: anti-CD38 antibodies bind CD38 on red cells and make the indirect antiglobulin test positive, masking real alloantibodies, so the transfusion laboratory must be warned before a crossmatch.\n\nCD3 is not a lineage antigen of the tumour in B-cell disease: it is the handle a T-cell-engaging bispecific antibody uses to grip a T cell. The cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity that can follow come from immune-cell activation, a systemic inflammatory mechanism that is distinct from injury to a healthy cell carrying the target, and they are graded separately (ASTCT) and reduced in practice with step-up dosing.",

    tldr: "Almost everyone carries Epstein-Barr virus for life without harm. Which lymphoma it can help cause depends on how many of its genes the infected cell is switching on, and that depends on how closely the immune system is watching.",
    summary: "Epstein-Barr virus was found by electron microscopy of cells cultured from Burkitt lymphoma, a childhood tumour whose distribution across equatorial Africa matched that of holoendemic malaria and so suggested a viral cause. It then turned out to be everywhere, persisting for life as an asymptomatic infection of the B-cell pool in the great majority of people (Young and Rickinson 2004). What makes it dangerous in a few of them is not the virus being present but which of its genes are switched on.\n\nLatency I expresses only EBNA1, enough to keep the viral episome copied when the cell divides and almost nothing for a T cell to recognise. This is the Burkitt pattern, where the virus sits alongside a MYC translocation.\n\nLatency II adds LMP1 and LMP2. LMP1 behaves like a CD40 receptor that is permanently switched on and drives NF-kB. This is the pattern in classical Hodgkin lymphoma and in extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma.\n\nLatency III expresses the full set of nuclear antigens and membrane proteins and will immortalise a resting B cell outright. It is kept in check entirely by T cells, which is why it appears when T cells are removed: post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder, HIV-associated lymphoma, and EBV-positive large B-cell lymphoma in older people whose immunity has aged.\n\nThe practical consequences are few but real. Reducing immunosuppression is the first treatment of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder, and it is the one place where acting on the virus changes the plan. Plasma EBV DNA is used to follow response in NK/T-cell lymphoma and in post-transplant disease. EBV-specific T cells are licensed for post-transplant disease that has failed other treatment. The share of each lymphoma that is EBV-positive varies so widely by subtype, geography and age that this entry does not quote one.",

    tldr: "A virus passed mostly from mother to child in breast milk, common in parts of Japan, the Caribbean, west Africa and South America. Most people who carry it never become ill, but in a few it causes an aggressive T-cell cancer decades later.",
    summary: "Human T-lymphotropic virus 1 integrates into the DNA of a CD4 T cell and stays there. Two of its genes matter. Tax switches on NF-kB and interferes with the DNA damage response and the spindle checkpoint, which is how the infected clone starts to expand and to accumulate damage; it is also the most visible protein to the immune system, so clones that silence it survive. HBZ, encoded on the opposite DNA strand, is kept on when Tax is switched off and sustains proliferation more quietly.\n\nWhat the host genome then acquires is not random. Across 426 cases analysed by whole-genome, exome, transcriptome and targeted sequencing with copy-number and methylation arrays, the alterations overlapped significantly with the set of proteins Tax itself binds, and were concentrated in T-cell receptor and NF-kB signalling, T-cell trafficking and immune surveillance: activating mutations in PLCG1, PRKCB, CARD11, VAV1, IRF4, FYN, CCR4 and CCR7, CTLA4-CD28 and ICOS-CD28 fusions, and intragenic deletions of IKZF2, CARD11 and TP73 (Kataoka 2015). The virus, in other words, starts the process and the cell finishes it along the lines the virus drew.\n\nThe practical consequence is CCR4. It is both frequently expressed and frequently mutated in this disease, and mogamulizumab, the anti-CCR4 antibody, is used because of it. The virus itself is not a drug target and antiviral treatment does not cure the leukaemia. Transmission is mainly through breastfeeding, and the interval between infection in infancy and the disease is measured in decades, which is why screening and formula feeding in endemic regions is a prevention question rather than a treatment one.",

    summary: "A classical Hodgkin lymph node under the microscope is mostly lymphocytes, eosinophils, plasma cells, macrophages and fibrous tissue, with occasional very large cells scattered through it. Those giants, the Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells, are the cancer, and for most of the twentieth century it was not clear what they even were: they had lost almost every marker of a B cell.\n\nThe question was settled by picking single cells off a histological section with a micromanipulator and amplifying their immunoglobulin genes. Each of three cases gave a single clonal heavy-chain rearrangement, proving the scattered giants were one clone; somatic mutation patterns placed their origin in the germinal centre in one case and earlier in B-cell development in another (Kuppers 1994).\n\nThe minority status is not a curiosity. It shapes the diagnosis, because a small needle sample can easily miss the diagnostic cells and a Hodgkin diagnosis often needs an excisional biopsy. It shapes the research, because sequencing a whole Hodgkin biopsy mostly measures the infiltrate, which is why the 9p24.1 amplification work needed laser capture and in situ hybridisation rather than bulk sequencing. And the infiltrate itself carries information: in an independent cohort of 166 patients, more CD68-positive macrophages meant shorter progression-free survival, more relapse after autologous transplant and shorter disease-specific survival, outperforming the International Prognostic Score (Steidl 2010).\n\nNone of that is yet a test that changes treatment.

A follicular lymphoma that has been watched for years can acquire MYC rearrangement, TP53 loss or CDKN2A deletion and start behaving as a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia can do the same, and that version has its own name, Richter transformation.\n\nThe genetics of Richter transformation were read across 86 pathologically proven cases: TP53 disruption in 47.1% and MYC abnormality in 26.2% were the dominant lesions, while the usual drivers of de novo diffuse large B-cell lymphoma were rare or absent. Whether the large-cell clone is related to the leukaemic clone matters more than any drug does: clonally unrelated cases had median survival of 62.5 months against 14.2 months for related ones, and less TP53 disruption, 23.1% against 60.0% (Rossi 2011).\n\nWhat prompts the suspicion: a single node or site growing much faster than the rest, new B symptoms, a rising LDH, or a PET scan with one area far brighter than the others. What settles it is a biopsy of the brightest area, because the question is answered by tissue and nothing else answers it.\n\nWhat changes: treatment moves to an aggressive-lymphoma regimen, the clonal relationship is worth establishing because it changes the expected course, and a trial is often the right answer in Richter transformation, where outcomes with standard chemoimmunotherapy are poor.",

The two lesions are complementary: MYC drives proliferation and would ordinarily trigger apoptosis, and BCL2 removes that safeguard. The WHO fifth edition recognises high-grade B-cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 rearrangements as a separate entity rather than a variant of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (Alaggio 2022).\n\nThe partner matters.

Alongside it, recurrent CIITA fusions, found in 38% of primary mediastinal B-cell lymphomas and 15% of classical Hodgkin lymphomas across 263 B-cell lymphomas, lower MHC class II on the tumour cell and place the ligands under new promoters (Steidl 2011).\n\nThis is the clearest genetic explanation in oncology for why one disease answers checkpoint blockade: PD-1 blockade gave an objective response in 20 of 23 heavily pre-treated Hodgkin patients, 87%, most of whom had already failed both autologous transplant and brentuximab vedotin (Ansell 2015).

The complementarity of the tubes is what makes the detection rate high: combined IGH and IGK tubes detect virtually all clonal B-cell proliferations even where somatic hypermutation is heavy, and combined TCRB and TCRG tubes detect virtually all clonal T-cell populations (van Dongen 2003).

      "The biology in detail, 1 of 5. The antigens. Ten surface targets carry the lymphoma medicines, and nine of the ten are normal proteins on normal cells. CD20 and CD19 are B-cell lineage antigens, so anti-CD20 and anti-CD19 treatments empty the B-cell compartment and leave hypogammaglobulinaemia, more infection, a blunted vaccine response and a risk of hepatitis B reactivation; after CAR-T the aplasia is deeper and can last years. CD79b and CD22 are also B-cell antigens, chosen for conjugates because they internalise. CD30 is the nearest to a restricted antigen, carried by activated lymphocytes and monocytes but not by resting ones, which is why brentuximab vedotin's limiting toxicity is the auristatin payload rather than the target. CD38 is mostly a myeloma antigen with no lymphoma approval and one laboratory consequence worth knowing, a positive indirect antiglobulin test that masks alloantibodies. CD47 is on every red cell, so blocking it causes anaemia by design and the dosing had to be redesigned around that. CCR4 is on regulatory T cells as well as on cutaneous and adult T-cell lymphoma, so depleting it causes rash and raises transplant risk. CD52 is on B cells, T cells, monocytes and dendritic cells at very high density, which makes alemtuzumab efficient and leaves CD4 counts low for a year.

MYC arrives the same way in Burkitt lymphoma, where it needs a partner that supplies survival: TCF3 or ID3 mutation in 70% of sporadic cases and CCND3 mutation in 38%. BCL6 is rearranged in 28.7% of large B-cell lymphomas. EZH2 Tyr646 substitutions, 7.2% of follicular and 21.7% of germinal-centre large B-cell lymphoma, are gain-of-function and absent from the activated subtype. CREBBP or EP300 inactivation affects about 39% and 41%, and KMT2D 32% and 89%. TP53 loss is the commonest route out of chemotherapy sensitivity, 11% in mantle cell lymphoma with median overall survival of 1.8 years against 12.7, and 47.1% in Richter transformation.",
      "The biology in detail, 3 of 5. The immune lesions and the viruses. Classical Hodgkin lymphoma and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma amplify 9p24.1, which carries both PD-1 ligand genes and JAK2; 97% of 108 classical Hodgkin lymphomas had concordant alterations of the two ligand loci, and CIITA, the master regulator of MHC class II, is rearranged in 38% of mediastinal and 15% of Hodgkin cases. That is why PD-1 blockade produced responses in 20 of 23 heavily pre-treated Hodgkin patients and does very little elsewhere in B-cell lymphoma. The Hodgkin node is mostly not cancer: the Reed-Sternberg cells are a small minority, their clonal B-cell identity had to be proved by picking single cells off a slide with a micromanipulator, and the infiltrate carries prognostic information of its own, with more CD68-positive macrophages predicting worse outcome. Two viruses matter. Epstein-Barr virus persists in almost everyone and causes different lymphomas according to which latency programme the infected cell runs: EBNA1 alone in Burkitt lymphoma, LMP1 added in Hodgkin and NK/T-cell lymphoma, and the full set where T-cell surveillance has gone. HTLV-1 starts adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma with Tax and HBZ, and the 426-case genomic analysis showed the acquired mutations cluster in the pathways Tax itself touches.",
      "The biology in detail, 4 of 5. Resistance. Anti-CD20 fails by transcriptional down-regulation of CD20, found in 5 of 19 rebiopsied relapses, and by trogocytosis, in which macrophages shave the antigen off a living cell. Covalent BTK inhibitors fail on-target through BTK C481S, found in five of six patients with acquired resistance, which is answered by a non-covalent inhibitor giving 73.3% responses after a covalent one; they also fail through gain-of-function PLCG2 mutations below the kinase, which no BTK inhibitor reaches. Non-covalent inhibitors are in turn defeated by L528W and T474I, and L528W is enriched after zanubrutinib specifically, 7 of 13 progressing patients against 1 of 24 after ibrutinib. Venetoclax fails through BCL2 G101V in its own binding groove, which lowers affinity about 180-fold, appeared in 7 of 15 paired patients and is detectable months before progression. CD19 CAR-T fails through antigen loss by deletion, exon 2 mutation or exon 2 skipping, through the fitness of the collected T cells, where memory signatures predict response and exhaustion signatures predict failure, and through the node itself. Checkpoint blockade in Hodgkin lymphoma fails with loss of MHC class II, not class I, which is what points at a CD4 T cell as the effector.",
      "The biology in detail, 5 of 5. The tests. An excisional biopsy rather than a core where it is possible, because architecture decides several of these diagnoses and because in Hodgkin lymphoma the malignant cells are rare enough to be missed. An immunohistochemistry panel of 10 to 12 stains, from which the Hans algorithm reads cell of origin. FISH for MYC, with BCL2 and BCL6 where MYC is rearranged or MYC protein is high, for CCND1 in a suspected mantle cell lymphoma, for t(11;18) in a gastric MALT lymphoma before relying on Helicobacter eradication, and for 9p24.1 where a research question needs it. Flow cytometry where cells can be put in suspension, which is how Sezary cells are counted and marrow involvement measured. Immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor clonality where the morphology is equivocal, remembering that clonality is not malignancy. A sequencing panel where TP53, MYD88, CXCR4, EZH2, BTK, PLCG2, BCL2 or the T-follicular-helper genes would change the plan. And FDG-PET, scored 1 to 5 against the mediastinal blood pool and the liver, which is the measurement lymphoma treatment is actually adapted to, with the warning that a score of 3 means different things in different protocols.",
