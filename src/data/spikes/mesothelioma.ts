    tldr: "Nearly every mesothelioma carries the surface protein mesothelin, yet the one antibody-drug conjugate tried in a randomised trial did no better than chemotherapy. The idea is to fix the three reasons it failed rather than abandon the approach.",
    summary: "Mesothelioma looks ideal for antibody-drug conjugates: mesothelin is on almost every tumour cell and rare elsewhere. Anetumab ravtansine, a mesothelin antibody carrying the tubulin poison DM4, proved otherwise in 248 patients, matching vinorelbine's 4.5-month progression-free survival and no more. Three explanations have evidence behind them. Mesothelioma sheds soluble mesothelin into the blood, which binds the antibody before it reaches the tumour. Expression is patchy and the tumour grows as thin sheets with dense stroma, so few cells take up enough payload. And a tubulin payload adds little to a slow-cycling tumour that already resists chemotherapy. The idea proposes conjugates built for these facts: antibodies that bind membrane mesothelin epitopes not present on the shed form, topoisomerase I payloads with a bystander effect that kill neighbouring cells that took up no drug (the DXd and SN-38 class that transformed breast and lung cancer ADCs), regional intrapleural delivery to bypass shed antigen in blood, and combination with PD-1 blockade to turn payload-induced cell death into an immune response, which the National Cancer Institute is already testing with anetumab ravtansine and pembrolizumab. Other targets present on mesothelioma, such as folate receptor alpha, on which the conjugate Rina-S is being tested across solid tumours, and B7-H3, widen the options beyond mesothelin.",
    hypothesis: "A mesothelin- or FRα-directed conjugate with a bystander-capable topoisomerase I payload, given with PD-1 blockade, will produce a response rate above 30 percent and median progression-free survival beyond 8 months in second-line pleural mesothelioma, roughly double what vinorelbine or anetumab ravtansine achieved.",
    rationale: "Mesothelin expression is near universal in epithelioid mesothelioma; TOP1-payload ADCs with bystander killing succeeded where tubulin-payload ADCs failed in HER2-low breast cancer and in lung cancer; shed antigen and heterogeneity are documented and addressable; the pleural space is accessible for regional dosing.",
    test: "Expansion cohorts for mesothelioma in ongoing trials of TOP1-payload conjugates against mesothelin and folate receptor alpha, measuring soluble mesothelin as a stratification factor; then a randomised second-line trial against vinorelbine or gemcitabine with progression-free survival as the primary endpoint.",

    summary: "Roughly half of pleural mesotheliomas carry a co-deletion of CDKN2A and MTAP, and this idea proposes exploiting the weakness that MTAP loss creates. Loss of MTAP raises intracellular MTA, which partially inhibits PRMT5, so MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors such as AMG 193, MRTX1719 and BMS-986504, and MAT2A inhibitors, gain a therapeutic window that first-generation PRMT5 inhibitors lacked. The rationale is a strong genetic dependency in DepMap, an easy immunohistochemistry test for MTAP loss, and early responses in MTAP-deleted tumours including mesothelioma. At an early clinical stage, the test would be expansion cohorts then a randomised second-line trial, and it connects to the ideas on attacking the backup copy of a lost gene and grouping trials by broken mechanism.",
    hypothesis: "MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitors will produce durable responses in MTAP-deleted mesothelioma after immunotherapy, with a therapeutic window absent for first-generation PRMT5 inhibitors.",

Mesothelin is expressed on almost all mesotheliomas, the pleural space is accessible, regional delivery avoids on-target lung toxicity, and in preclinical models CAR-T exhaustion is reversible with checkpoint blockade. A phase 1 study at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center led by Adusumilli combined intrapleural CAR-T with pembrolizumab and produced responses and some long survivors.

    summary: "Malignant pleural mesothelioma arises from the lining of the lung, almost always decades after asbestos exposure, and is rising in countries that banned asbestos late or not at all. It grows along surfaces rather than as a mass, is hard to image and stage, and resists most systemic therapy. Histology is the dominant biological variable: epithelioid tumours are slower and chemosensitive; sarcomatoid and biphasic tumours are aggressive, chemoresistant, and paradoxically more immunotherapy-responsive.\n\nFor 16 years after pemetrexed-cisplatin (2004) nothing improved survival except, modestly, adding bevacizumab (MAPS, 2016). Immunotherapy then changed the first line twice: nivolumab-ipilimumab (CheckMate 743, approved 2020) and pembrolizumab with chemotherapy (IND.227/KEYNOTE-483, approved September 2024). Tumour treating fields hold a device approval on single-arm data. Radical surgery, long assumed beneficial, was shown by MARS 2 (2024) to shorten survival and worsen quality of life, and is now largely confined to trials.\n\nWhat comes next is biology-led: PRMT5 and MAT2A inhibitors for the ~40-50% of tumours with MTAP deletion, mesothelin-directed CAR-T delivered into the pleural space, ADCs and T-cell engagers against mesothelin, and better use of histology and BAP1/CDKN2A status to choose therapy. Prevention remains the biggest lever: asbestos is still mined and used in parts of Asia, Russia, and Brazil.",
