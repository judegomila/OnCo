A phase 1 study at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center led by Adusumilli combined intrapleural CAR-T with pembrolizumab and produced responses and some long survivors. The next step is a phase 2 with a second-line control and an armoured CAR-T arm; at an early clinical stage, it addresses the bottleneck of cold tumours and the idea of treating the body cavity rather than the bloodstream.",
    hypothesis: "Intrapleural mesothelin CAR-T plus PD-1 blockade achieves median OS beyond 24 months in relapsed mesothelioma, exceeding historical second-line outcomes.",
    rationale: "Mesothelin is near-universally expressed; the pleural space is accessible; CAR-T exhaustion is reversible with checkpoint blockade in preclinical models.",
    test: "Phase 2 with a contemporaneous control (second-line chemotherapy or nivolumab), OS endpoint; armoured (PD-1 dominant-negative) CAR-T variant as a second arm.",

    summary: "Malignant pleural mesothelioma arises from the lining of the lung, almost always decades after asbestos exposure, and is rising in countries that banned asbestos late or not at all. It grows along surfaces rather than as a mass, is hard to image and stage, and resists most systemic therapy. Histology is the dominant biological variable: epithelioid tumours are slower and chemosensitive; sarcomatoid and biphasic tumours are aggressive, chemoresistant, and paradoxically more immunotherapy-responsive.\n\nFor 16 years after pemetrexed-cisplatin (2004) nothing improved survival except, modestly, adding bevacizumab (MAPS, 2016). Immunotherapy then changed the first line twice: nivolumab-ipilimumab (CheckMate 743, approved 2020) and pembrolizumab with chemotherapy (IND.227/KEYNOTE-483, approved September 2024). Tumour treating fields hold a device approval on single-arm data. Radical surgery, long assumed beneficial, was shown by MARS 2 (2024) to shorten survival and worsen quality of life, and is now largely confined to trials.\n\nWhat comes next is biology-led: PRMT5 and MAT2A inhibitors for the ~40-50% of tumours with MTAP deletion, mesothelin-directed CAR-T delivered into the pleural space, ADCs and T-cell engagers against mesothelin, and better use of histology and BAP1/CDKN2A status to choose therapy. Prevention remains the biggest lever: asbestos is still mined and used in parts of Asia, Russia, and Brazil.",
    burden: "Mesothelioma causes about 30,000 cases a year worldwide, ~3,000 in the US, almost all from asbestos exposure 20-50 years earlier, so incidence is still rising in Asia and parts of Europe. Immunotherapy has produced the first tail of long-term survivors; median survival is 12-18 months.",
