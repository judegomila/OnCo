    summary: "Neuroblastoma arises from developing sympathetic nerve cells, usually in the adrenal gland or along the spine, and is the most common cancer of infants and the most common extracranial solid tumour of childhood. It spans the widest clinical range in oncology: some infant tumours (stage MS) regress without treatment, while high-risk disease (about half of patients, defined by INRG stage, age over 18 months, MYCN amplification and other genomic features) is cured in only 50-60% despite the most intensive therapy given to children, which is where anti-GD2 antibodies and CAR-T have made their gains. ALK mutations (~10%) are the main druggable driver; MYCN, though not directly druggable, points to polyamine and ALK biology.\n\nHigh-risk therapy is a year-long sequence: five to six cycles of induction chemotherapy, surgery, myeloablative chemotherapy with autologous stem-cell rescue (tandem transplant in North America after ANBL0532; busulfan-melphalan single transplant in Europe after HR-NBL1), radiotherapy to the primary site, then anti-GD2 immunotherapy (dinutuximab or dinutuximab beta with GM-CSF; IL-2 abandoned after HR-NBL1) and isotretinoin. Anti-GD2 antibody raised survival by about 20 points (ANBL0032). Since December 2023, two years of oral eflornithine (DFMO) is approved as maintenance on the strength of an externally controlled study; naxitamab and irinotecan-temozolomide-dinutuximab treat relapse; lorlatinib is being added for ALK-aberrant tumours and 131I-MIBG tested in induction (ANBL1531).\n\nNeuroblastoma is also where CAR-T first produced lasting cures in a solid tumour: GD2-CART01 (Bambino Gesù, NEJM 2023) achieved 63% responses and 33% complete remissions in relapsed disease, with some remissions lasting more than a decade. The open questions are whether cell therapy can consolidate first-line remission, how to reduce the lifelong burden of hearing loss, infertility and second cancers in survivors, how to treat MYCN-amplified relapse, and how to bring anti-GD2 therapy to the majority of children in the world who cannot access it.",
