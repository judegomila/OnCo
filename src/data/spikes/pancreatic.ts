    summary: "Elicio Therapeutics, based in Boston and listed as ELTX, is a small biotechnology company developing lymph-node-targeted vaccines against mutant KRAS for pancreatic and colorectal cancer. Its lead candidate, ELI-002 7P, is an amphiphile vaccine designed to carry mutant KRAS peptides to lymph nodes, and the AMPLIFY-7P phase 2 trial missed its primary endpoint in June 2026, after which the company said its phase 3 strategy was being refined. OnCo links it to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and to the bottleneck of undruggable drivers, since KRAS vaccination is one route around the difficulty of inhibiting the protein directly. Whether a shared-antigen KRAS vaccine can succeed in a phase 3 where the phase 2 did not is the open question. ELI-002 7P has its own page.",

    tldr: "If daraxonrasib shrinks metastatic tumours this well, use it before surgery to make more locally advanced tumours operable.",
    summary: "The proposal is to give the RAS(ON) inhibitor daraxonrasib, with or without chemotherapy, before surgery for borderline resectable and locally advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, to see whether it raises the R0 resection rate compared with mFOLFIRINOX. Surgery remains the only route to cure, yet only a minority of patients present with resectable disease. The rationale is the deep and rapid responses seen with daraxonrasib and zoldonrasib, oral dosing, ctDNA clearance as an early surrogate, and the fact that RASolute 303 and 304 already move the drug earlier. The test would be a randomised phase 2 with R0 resection as the primary endpoint. At an early clinical stage, it addresses the bottleneck of the undruggable drivers.",

    summary: "Adults who develop diabetes after the age of 50 carry a raised risk of harbouring an occult pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and this idea proposes testing their blood rather than waiting for symptoms. Risk-stratified testing with a multi-cancer early detection assay such as Galleri, or a multi-analyte CA 19-9 panel, would be offered to people with a high END-PAC score, with imaging reserved for those who test positive. Because cancer is far more prevalent in this enriched group, the positive predictive value of a blood test rises into a useful range. The test would be a prospective NOD-type cohort with blinded blood testing and three years of cancer ascertainment. At an early clinical stage, it addresses the bottleneck that the hardest cancers are found late.",

    summary: "This combination pairs zoldonrasib, a KRAS G12D-selective inhibitor, with daraxonrasib, a pan-RAS(ON) inhibitor, in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma carrying the G12D mutation. The mutant-selective drug spares normal tissue, while the pan-RAS drug blocks the wild-type RAS and secondary-mutation escape routes that limit single agents, giving vertical suppression of adaptive RAS reactivation along the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. The evidence comes from a phase 1/2 study in second-line RAS G12D metastatic disease presented at ESMO GI 2026, which reported a high response rate and disease control with a manageable safety profile. It illustrates how a mutation-specific and a pathway-wide inhibitor can be layered so that the tumour cannot escape through a wild-type RAS relative.",

    summary: "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is defined by late presentation, a near-universal KRAS mutation (G12D ~40%, G12V ~30%, G12R ~15%, G12C ~1-2%; ~10% KRAS-wild-type with actionable fusions in NRG1, NTRK, ALK, or BRAF), a desmoplastic stroma that occupies most of the tumour, and an immunologically cold microenvironment. Surgery is the only cure and only ~20% of patients present resectable; five-year survival remains ~13% overall but exceeds 40% for resected patients who complete adjuvant mFOLFIRINOX.\n\nFor thirty years the story was chemotherapy: gemcitabine (1997), FOLFIRINOX (2011), gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel (2013), adjuvant mFOLFIRINOX (PRODIGE 24, 2018), NALIRIFOX (2024), with olaparib maintenance for germline BRCA carriers (POLO, 2019) and zenocutuzumab for NRG1 fusions (2024) as the only biomarker-directed drugs. 2026 changed the trajectory. Optune Pax tumour treating fields were approved for locally advanced disease (PANOVA-3). Daraxonrasib, a pan-RAS(ON) inhibitor, nearly doubled overall survival in previously treated metastatic disease in RASolute 302 (13.2 vs 6.7 months, HR 0.40), presented in the ASCO 2026 plenary with simultaneous NEJM publication; regulatory filing is expected under a national priority voucher. The G12D-selective zoldonrasib, combined with daraxonrasib or with chemotherapy, produced response rates never before seen in this disease.\n\nWhat remains unsolved: detection (no screening outside high-risk surveillance; MCED tests and new-onset-diabetes enrichment are the leading ideas), the stroma and immune exclusion that have defeated every checkpoint inhibitor trial, resistance to RAS inhibitors (already emerging), and the fact that half of patients are too frail for the most effective regimens. The most promising directions are RAS inhibitors moving into first line and neoadjuvant settings, personalised (autogene cevumeran) and shared-antigen (ELI-002 7P) vaccines in the adjuvant setting despite AMPLIFY-7P's miss, CLDN18.2 and FAP-directed delivery, and blood-based early detection.",
