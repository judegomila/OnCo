A Japanese trial (Takahashi 2017) with MRI surveillance showed no survival benefit in extensive-stage disease. Hippocampal-avoidance PCI (PREMER, NRG CC003) reduces cognitive harm. The MAVERICK/SWOG S1827 trial of PCI versus MRI surveillance is the definitive test; results pending.",

    asOf,
    summary: "Small-cell lung cancer is a high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma, almost always caused by smoking, defined by near-universal loss of TP53 and RB1 and by explosive growth. It presents as extensive-stage disease in two thirds of patients, responds to chemotherapy in most, and relapses in almost all. For three decades the treatment was platinum-etoposide, thoracic radiotherapy for limited-stage disease, prophylactic cranial irradiation, and topotecan at relapse.\n\nThe field moved in three steps. First-line chemo-immunotherapy (IMpower133 2018, CASPIAN 2019, ASTRUM-005 2022) added two to five months of median survival and a small tail of long-term survivors. Consolidation durvalumab after chemoradiotherapy for limited-stage disease (ADRIATIC, approved December 2024) was the first curative-intent advance in 30 years, lifting median survival to nearly five years. In relapsed disease, tarlatamab, the DLL3 T-cell engager, became the first drug to beat chemotherapy on overall survival (DeLLphi-304; full FDA approval November 2025), and lurbinectedin plus atezolizumab became the first approved first-line maintenance regimen (IMforte, October 2025).\n\nWhat is next: maintenance intensification with tarlatamab (DeLLphi-305), the B7-H3 ADC ifinatamab deruxtecan in second line (IDeate-Lung02), alpha-emitting SSTR radioligands (RYZ101), subtype-directed therapy (ASCL1, NEUROD1, POU2F3, inflamed), bispecific and trispecific DLL3 engagers, and the settled question of whether MRI surveillance can replace prophylactic cranial irradiation. Screening remains limited to low-dose CT in smokers, which detects few small-cell cancers early.",
    burden: "Small-cell lung cancer makes up about 15% of lung cancers, roughly 250,000 cases a year worldwide, almost entirely in current or former smokers. Limited-stage disease is treated with curative intent and now with durvalumab consolidation. Median survival is nearly five years in limited-stage and about one year in extensive-stage disease.",
