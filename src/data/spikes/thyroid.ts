The evidence is the anaplastic cohort of the phase 2 ROAR trial plus the MD Anderson institutional series, in which previously unresectable tumours became operable and responders lived far longer than the historical expectation; there is no randomised trial because the disease is so rare.

MAPK signalling suppresses the sodium-iodide symporter, and blocking the pathway for four to six weeks re-expresses NIS, so the tumour takes up iodine again. Selumetinib, reported in NEJM in 2013, and later dabrafenib and trametinib restored uptake in a substantial share of refractory patients, especially those with RAS mutations, and durable responses followed in some; the evidence is multiple phase 2 series.

Incidence has tripled in many countries since the 1990s while deaths stayed flat, autopsies find occult papillary cancer in many adults, and the Kuma Hospital and MSK cohorts show surveillance is safe.

    summary: "Thyroid cancer is really several diseases. Differentiated thyroid cancer (papillary ~85%, follicular, oncocytic) arises from follicular cells, retains iodine uptake, and has a 10-year survival above 95%; its incidence has tripled in many countries because ultrasound finds tiny tumours that would never have caused harm. Medullary thyroid cancer comes from calcitonin-producing C cells, is driven by RET mutations (hereditary in MEN2), and does not take up iodine. Anaplastic thyroid cancer is rare, dedifferentiated, and historically progressed within months; BRAF/MEK inhibition and immunotherapy have started to change that.\n\nDifferentiated disease is treated by surgery, with radioactive iodine (the first theranostic, 1946) reserved for intermediate and high-risk patients after HiLo, ESTIMABL2, and IoN showed low-risk patients gain nothing from it; active surveillance is accepted for microcarcinomas, and lobectomy suffices for many. When cancer becomes radioiodine-refractory, lenvatinib (SELECT) and sorafenib (DECISION) extend progression-free survival, and genotype directs selective therapy: selpercatinib for RET fusions, larotrectinib for NTRK, dabrafenib-trametinib for BRAF. Medullary cancer moved from vandetanib and cabozantinib to RET-selective selpercatinib after LIBRETTO-531 (2023). Anaplastic cancer with BRAF V600E responds to dabrafenib-trametinib (ROAR), often enabling surgery, and triplets with pembrolizumab are producing multi-year survivors.\n\nThe field's biggest problems are the opposite of most cancers': over-detection and over-treatment of indolent disease, alongside the unsolved lethality of anaplastic and RAI-refractory disease, resistance to RET inhibitors (solvent-front mutations), and the toxicity of long-term multikinase therapy.",
