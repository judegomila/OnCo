/**
 * Canonical glossary categories. Terms are written across many files with category labels that drifted
 * ("Regulatory", "regulatory", "Regulation", "policy"; "Genetics", "genetics", "Genomics"), which made the
 * glossary grid ragged and split the same idea over several tiles. Every term is mapped here to one of
 * twenty-one categories at load time (see ALL_INPUTS in ./index.ts); the raw files are left as written.
 *
 * Twenty of the categories are oncology; the twenty-first, "Methods and models", holds the machine-learning,
 * statistics, data-standard and licensing vocabulary a reader meets in cancer AI papers (added 24 Sept 2026 from the
 * CanSim terms map). Each has an animation in ./term-animations.ts, which a test asserts.
