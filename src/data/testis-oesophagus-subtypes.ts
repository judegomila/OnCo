    summary: "Seminoma arises from germ cell neoplasia in situ and presents as a painless testicular mass, with modest rises in hCG and LDH but never AFP, which would mark a non-seminomatous element. After radical inguinal orchidectomy, stage I disease is managed by surveillance in most men, since only about one in six relapse and all are salvageable; a single dose of carboplatin (MRC TE19) or, rarely now, para-aortic radiotherapy are alternatives. Stage II disease with small nodes is treated with radiotherapy or chemotherapy, and bulkier or metastatic disease with three cycles of BEP or four of EP, curing more than 90 percent; residual masses after chemotherapy are assessed with PET rather than removed. Long-term follow-up watches for second cancers and cardiovascular effects of treatment.",

Metastatic disease receives three cycles of BEP for good risk and four for intermediate and poor risk; residual masses after chemotherapy are resected by retroperitoneal lymph node dissection because a third contain teratoma and a tenth viable cancer. Relapse is treated with conventional or high-dose salvage chemotherapy, compared head to head in the TIGER trial. Fertility preservation and long-term follow-up are routine.",

Locally advanced disease is treated either with neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery (CROSS) or with definitive chemoradiation alone, which cures a similar share in this histology; adjuvant nivolumab after chemoradiation and surgery lowers recurrence when residual disease remains (CheckMate 577). Advanced disease is treated with nivolumab plus chemotherapy or nivolumab plus ipilimumab (CheckMate 648) or pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy (KEYNOTE-590); Chinese trials with camrelizumab, tislelizumab, toripalimab and sintilimab have produced the same result.",
