    burden: "About four in five thyroid cancers; incidence tripled over three decades in many countries mainly through ultrasound detection of small tumours, while deaths barely changed; more than nine in ten patients are alive at ten years.",
    tldr: "Papillary thyroid cancer is the commonest and most curable thyroid cancer. Most people are treated with surgery, some with radioactive iodine afterwards, and many small tumours can simply be watched. Only the rare tumours that stop taking up iodine need targeted drugs.",
    summary: "Papillary thyroid cancer arises from the follicular cells and often spreads to neck lymph nodes but rarely kills. About 60 percent carry a BRAF V600E mutation and others RET or NTRK fusions or RAS mutations. Treatment is lobectomy or total thyroidectomy, with radioactive iodine reserved for intermediate- and high-risk disease after the ESTIMABL2 and IoN trials showed low-risk patients do as well without it; TSH suppression with levothyroxine and thyroglobulin monitoring follow. Japanese studies established that papillary microcarcinomas under a centimetre can be kept under active surveillance, and guidelines now allow it. The minority whose recurrent or metastatic disease no longer takes up iodine are treated with lenvatinib or sorafenib, or with selpercatinib, larotrectinib or dabrafenib-trametinib when the matching alteration is found.",

    burden: "About one in ten thyroid cancers, commoner where iodine is scarce; it spreads through the blood to bone and lung rather than to neck nodes, and survival is somewhat lower than for papillary cancer but still high.",
    tldr: "Follicular thyroid cancer looks like a benign nodule on a needle biopsy, so the diagnosis is usually made only after surgery. It spreads through the bloodstream rather than to neck nodes, is treated like papillary cancer with surgery and radioactive iodine, and has a good outlook when caught early.",
    summary: "Follicular thyroid cancer is separated from a benign follicular adenoma only by invasion of the capsule or blood vessels, which a fine-needle biopsy cannot show; a follicular result on biopsy therefore leads to diagnostic lobectomy, and molecular tests on the aspirate now help decide who needs it. RAS mutations and the PAX8-PPARG fusion are common, and TERT promoter mutations mark aggressive disease. Minimally invasive tumours are cured by lobectomy; widely invasive tumours receive total thyroidectomy and radioactive iodine, which also treats the lung and bone metastases the disease favours. Oncocytic (Hurthle cell) carcinoma, once a follicular variant, is a separate entity in the 2022 WHO classification and takes up iodine poorly. Iodine-refractory disease is treated as in papillary cancer with lenvatinib or sorafenib.",

    tldr: "Medullary thyroid cancer comes from the calcitonin-making C cells, not the thyroid hormone cells, so radioactive iodine does not work. Surgery is the only cure, a quarter of cases run in families through the RET gene, and the RET-selective drug selpercatinib has transformed treatment of advanced disease.",
    summary: "Medullary thyroid cancer arises from the parafollicular C cells and secretes calcitonin, which serves as its tumour marker. Germline RET mutations cause the hereditary forms (MEN2A, MEN2B and familial medullary thyroid cancer), and children who inherit them have the thyroid removed before cancer develops, timed by the mutation's risk level; most sporadic tumours carry a somatic RET M918T mutation, and a minority RAS mutations. Total thyroidectomy with central neck dissection is the only curative treatment, and calcitonin doubling time guides follow-up. For progressive advanced disease, vandetanib (2011) and cabozantinib (2012) were the first approved kinase inhibitors; selpercatinib, a RET-selective inhibitor, beat them in the LIBRETTO-531 trial and is now the standard for RET-mutant disease, with pralsetinib as an alternative. Phaeochromocytoma must be excluded before any thyroid surgery in MEN2.",

    summary: "Anaplastic thyroid cancer is an undifferentiated carcinoma that usually arises from a pre-existing papillary or follicular cancer through the accumulation of TP53 and TERT mutations; about 40 percent carry BRAF V600E. It presents in older adults as a hard, rapidly growing neck mass with hoarseness, breathing or swallowing difficulty, and it does not take up iodine. Every case is staged IV. Rapid molecular testing is now urged at diagnosis because BRAF V600E tumours respond to dabrafenib plus trametinib, approved in 2018 on the ROAR basket trial, and neoadjuvant use has made some inoperable tumours resectable; pembrolizumab added to targeted therapy and chemoradiation for resectable disease are part of the multimodal approach that raised one-year survival at MD Anderson from about a fifth to over half.
