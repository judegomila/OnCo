/**
 * The universe: how much of each kind exists in the world, so OnCo can state its own completeness.
 *
 * Every denominator is a real, checkable figure from a named source, with the method that produced it
 * and the date it was checked. Fetched figures come from the snapshots in universe-lists/ (refreshed
 * weekly by `npm run fetch:universe`, scripts/fetch-universe.ts); fixed figures are typed here with
 * their citation. Where a figure is a round number, a text-search hit count or depends on name parsing,
 * `approx` is true and the UI says "about". Kinds that OnCo defines itself (fronts, technologies,
 * pairings, roadmaps, ideas, bottlenecks, collections) have no external denominator and say so.
 *
 * src/lib/completeness.ts turns each denominator into "in OnCo / of / missing" using the same scope
 * on the corpus side (approved products against an approved-drugs list, and so on).
