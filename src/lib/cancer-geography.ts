/**
 * Geography layer for a cancer: where in the world it happens, and why. Two parts sit under one cancer id.
 *
 *  1. Country rates by sex. GLOBOCAN reports the site-wide countries.json (public/globocan/countries.json) for both
 *     sexes only; for cancers whose geography differs by sex the per-site files in public/globocan/sites/ carry
 *     both sexes, women and men for every country (fetched by scripts/fetch-globocan-site.ts from the same IARC
 *     factsheet endpoint). SITE_RATES maps a GLOBOCAN cancer code to its file.
 *
 *  2. A hand-written `CancerGeography`: the high-burden regions with the papers that describe them, the national
 *     programmes and registries, the prevention evidence, the country spotlights and the named gaps. Written in a
 *     spike file (src/data/spikes/<cancer>-geography.ts) and registered in CANCER_GEOGRAPHIES below. The cancer page
 *     renders the map and the cards in its epidemiology section (src/components/CancerGeographySection.tsx); the JSON
 *     companion is written to /api/v1/cancers/<id>/geography.json by scripts/build-api.ts.
 *
 * Nothing here is generated: every figure carries the page it was read from and the date it was checked.
