/**
 * Denominator drift: a percentage gauge silently changes its meaning when the population it divides by grows.
 *
 * On 23 and 24 September 2026 the corpus went from about 12,400 records to 18,160 in a day (five deep cancer dives,
 * 99 new subtype pages, a 1,447-gene catalogue layer, hundreds of papers, thousands of registry trials). Eleven
 * gauges fell below target overnight, and for four of them nothing had got worse: `target-prevalence` read 11 per
 * cent because 1,442 catalogue genes with no medicine attached had joined the 232 targets the gauge was written for,
 * and `cancer-depth` read 71 per cent because 99 pages written deliberately thin ("treated as its parent") were
 * being counted as shallow. The dashboard degraded quietly and the numbers were read as a data gap for two days.
 *
 * So each gauge's denominator is recorded here with the label that was true of it. The test fails when a denominator
 * moves by more than MAX_DRIFT and the label has not changed, which is the exact shape of that failure: more records,
 * same claim about what is being counted. Two ways out, and the choice is the point of the test:
 *
 *   - the new records are the kind the gauge asks about: update the row's `total` and say so in the commit;
 *   - they are not: change the check so it counts the right population, restate `label` to say plainly what it
 *     counts and what it leaves out, and update the row.
 *
 * Never lower `target` to make a gauge pass. A target is a promise about the corpus; the denominator is a fact
 * about it. Only one of the two is allowed to move to settle an argument.
 *
 * Labels are compared as MetricDef.label, without the parenthesised note health() appends: the note carries live
 * counts and changes on every data commit.
