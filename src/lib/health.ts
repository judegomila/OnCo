/**
 * Corpus health: coverage metrics computed from the graph at build time.
 *
 * Each metric asks one question of every record it applies to ("does this drug have a molecule or an
 * explained placeholder?") and reports how many pass, how many were checked, the worst offenders, and
 * the one action that would fix a failing record. The Roadmap page renders these as gauges and uses
 * them to downgrade any idea whose "shipped" claim the corpus contradicts.
 *
 * To add a metric, append a definition to METRIC_DEFS. Give it a stable id (used in URL anchors and in
 * HubIdea.metric), a plain sentence, an action, and a `check` that returns the records checked and the
 * failing ones in worst-first order. Nothing else needs to change.
