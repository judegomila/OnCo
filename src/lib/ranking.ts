 *   nciPoints       = comprehensive 15 | clinical 8 | basic 8 | none 0
 *   linkPoints      = 2 × (distinct objects in this corpus that link to or from the institution)
 *
 *   score = newsweekPoints + nciPoints + linkPoints
 *
 * The third term rewards institutions that appear in the evidence base (trials led, drugs

 * how well this corpus covers an institution, and will change as the corpus grows.
