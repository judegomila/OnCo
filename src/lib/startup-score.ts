 * Ranking of the requests for startups (roadmap row 112). Two axes, each 0 to 100, from disclosed dimensions:
 *
 *   Urgency (patient need)
 *     survival         five-year relative survival of the worst-served cancer the idea names (SEER, public/survival/index.json); lower is more urgent
 *     approvedOptions  approved treatments or tests in the corpus for the least-served cancer named; fewer is more urgent
 *     incidence        new cases a year worldwide across the cancers named (GLOBOCAN, public/globocan); more is more urgent
 *     bottleneck       severity of the worst bottleneck record that names the idea (critical 3, major 2, moderate 1, none 0)
 *
 *   Commerciality
 *     addressable      incidence times the share the idea reaches: the target's prevalence in the cancer when the idea names a target with
 *                      a sourced prevalence, otherwise every diagnosed patient (no narrowing field on the record)
 *     payerPath        how clear the route to being paid is, by solution type (see PAYER_PATH)
 *     routeYears       years to first revenue by regulatory route, by solution type (see ROUTE_YEARS)
 *     competitors      companies and trials in the corpus on the same technologies and cancers; fewer is more whitespace
 *     capital          the idea's own cost band (small under 1m, medium 1 to 50m, large over 50m dollars); smaller is better
 *     evidence         the idea's maturity field (speculative 0 to being tested at scale 3)
 *
 * Every dimension is min-max normalised against the whole set (counts on a log scale), then the axis score is the weighted mean of
 * the dimensions that could be scored. A dimension with no input is marked "not scored" and dropped from the mean rather than guessed.
 * The composite is the geometric mean of the two axes, so a request needs both need and a market to rise.
 *
 * Solution type: ideas whose actor is "data" are software; otherwise it is read from the technology records the idea links to
 * (TECH_TYPE_RULES). An idea with neither has no type and the type-based dimensions are not scored.
