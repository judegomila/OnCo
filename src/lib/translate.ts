 *   translate="no"   on names and identifiers that must never be translated: drug and product names, gene and protein
 *                    symbols, trial ids and acronyms, company and institution names, doses and units, database ids.
 *                    The `notranslate` class is the same instruction for Google's translator, which predates the
 *                    attribute and still honours the class.
